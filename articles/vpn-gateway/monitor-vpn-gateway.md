# Monitor Azure VPN Gateway

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

<!-- ## Insights. OPTIONAL. If your service has Azure Monitor insights, add the following include and add information about what your insights provide. You can refer to another article that gives details or add a screenshot. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights.md)] -->

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]

For more information about the resource types for VPN Gateway, see [Azure VPN Gateway monitoring data reference](monitor-vpn-gateway-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for VPN Gateway are listed in [VPN Gateway monitoring data reference](monitor-vpn-gateway-reference.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling these settings requires additional Azure services (storage account, event hub, or Log Analytics), which may increase your cost. To calculate an estimated cost, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.
