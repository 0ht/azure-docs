### Enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication on your cache

1. In the Azure portal, select the Azure Cache for Redis instance where you'd like to configure Microsoft Entra token-based authentication.

1. Select **Authentication** from the Resource menu.

1. In the working pane, select **Enable Microsoft Entra Authentication**.

1. Select **Enable Microsoft Entra Authentication**, and enter the name of a valid user. The user you enter is automatically assigned _Data Owner Access Policy_ by default when you select **Save**. You can also enter a managed identity or service principal to connect to your cache instance.

1. A popup dialog box displays asking if you want to update your configuration, and informing you that it takes several minutes. SelectÂ **Yes.**

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Once the enable operation is complete, the nodes in your cache instance reboots to load the new configuration. We recommend performing this operation during your maintenance window or outside your peak business hours. The operation can take up to 30 minutes.

For information on using Microsoft Entra ID with Azure CLI, see the [references pages for identity](/cli/azure/redis/identity).
