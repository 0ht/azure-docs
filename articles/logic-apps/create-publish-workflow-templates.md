[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-standard.md)]

Azure Logic Apps provides prebuilt integration workflow templates that you can use to accelerate the process of building integration applications. These templates follow commonly used patterns and help developers streamline development by providing a starting point or baseline with predefined business logic and configurations. You can include artifacts such as schemas, maps, and assemblies with the workflow templates that you create.

## Prerequisites




## Limitations

- Workflow templates currently support Standard logic apps and single workflows. 

## What templates to build?

The following list provides some example ideas:

## What does a template package include?

Every template includes the following files:

| File name | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **workflow.json** | Yes | The workflow definition in JSON format. |
| **manifest.json** | Yes | |
| **snapshot-light.png** | Yes | |
| **snapshot-dark.png** | Yes | |
| **<*map-name*>.json**, **.xml**, or **.xslt** | No | |
| **<*custom-assembly*>.dll** | No | |
| **readme.md** | No | |

You can also include any other files to maintain your template, for example, files that contain test or sample data.

## Create a workflow template

Create the workflow for which you want to create the template. Your workflow likely will have references to Service Providers, API connections or libraries. In this section, weâ€™ll explain how to templatize your entire solution.

### Create a workflow.json file

Workflow.json is the workflow definition. You can simply copy the workflow definition from the code view and save it as workflow.json. Here is an example -  

To include the folder name for your template, you must update this [manifest.json file in the template gallery's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/LogicAppsTemplates/blob/main/manifest.json).

## Create a workflow overview image

In the overview page of the templates, we intend to show the read only view of the workflow. You can take a screenshot of your workflow and provide that image file. You can name it anything  - just make sure to use that name in the manifest.json in the images section 

## Create a manifest.json file

Until we have the tooling available, creating this file will be a manual process. The information that goes in this file describes the workflow and its related components. You can use the manifest.json from one of the existing templates here instead of starting from scratch. 

| Attribute name | Required | Value | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **`title`** | Yes | <*template-title*> | The title that appears in the templates gallery, which opens when you add a workflow from a template in the Azure portal. |
| **`description`** | Yes | <*template-description*> | The template description, which appears on the template's overview pane in the template gallery. |
| **`sku`** | Yes | **`standard`**, **`consumption`** | The logic app workflow type supported by the template. If you're not sure, use **`standard`**. |
| **`prerequisites`** | No | <*template-prerequisites*> | Any prerequisites to meet for using the template. Appears in the template's overview pane. You can link to other documents from this section. |
| **`kinds`** | No | **`stateful`**, **`stateless`** | The workflow mode, which determines whether run history and operation states are stored. <br><br>By default, all workflows are available in both stateful and stateless mode. If your workflow only runs in stateful mode, use this attribute to make this requirement explicit. |
| **`tags`** | No | <*template-tags-array*> | The template tags to use for searching or filtering templates. |
| **`details`** | No | See description. | Template information to use for filtering the templates gallery. <br><br>- **`By`**: The template publisher, for example, **`Microsoft`**. <br><br>- **`Type`**: **`Workflow`** <br><br>- **`Trigger`**: The trigger type, for example, **`Recurrence`**, **`Event`**, or **`Request`**. |
| **`artifacts`** | No | <*artifacts-array*> | All the relevant files in the template package and includes the following attributes: <br><br>- **`type`**: The file type, which determines the appropriate location for where to copy the file, for example **`workflow`**. <br><br>- **`file`**: The file name and extension. | 
| **`images`** | Yes | **`snapshot-light.png`**, **`snapshot-dark.png`** | The workflow screenshots for light and dark browser themes. Don't include a lot of whitespace around the workflow. |
| **`parameters`** | Yes | <*workflow-parameters-array*> | The parameters to use for workflow creation. For each parameter, you need to specify the following properties: <br><br>- **`name`**: The parameter name must have the suffix, **`_#workflowname#`**, use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens or underscores, and follow this format: <br><br>**`<parameter-name>_#workflowname#`** <br><br>- **`displayName`**: The parameter's friendly display name. See [Names and style conventions](#names-style-conventions). <br><br>- **`type`**: The parameter's data type, for example **`String`** or **`Int`**. <br><br>- **`default`**: The parameter's default value, if any. If none, leave this value as an empty string. <br><br>- **`description`** The parameter's details and other important or helpful information. <br><br>- **`required`**: **`true`** or **`false`** |
| **`connections`** | Yes, but can be empty if no connections exist. | <*connections-array*> | The connections to use in workflow creation. Each connection has the following properties: <br><br>-**`connectorId`**: The connector ID must have the suffix, **`_#workflowname#`**, use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens or underscores, and follow this format: <br><br>**`<connector-ID>_#workflowname#`** <br><br>To find the connector ID, see [Find the connector ID](#find-connector-id). <br><br>- **`kind`**: The connector's runtime host type, which is either **`inapp`** for built-in operations and service provider-based connectors or **`shared`** for managed, Azure-hosted connectors. In the connectors gallery, built-in operations and service provider-based connectors are labeled as **In App**, while managed connectors are labeled as **Shared**. |
| **`featuredConnections`** | No | <*featured-connections-array*> | By default, the template gallery shows icons for the prebuilt operations and connectors in Azure Logic Apps used by each template. To include icons for any other operations, you can use the **`featuredConnections`** attribute. Each operation must have the following properties: <br><br>- **`kind`**: The operation kind <br><br>- **`type`**: The operation type <br><br>To find these values, see [Find the operation kind and type for featuredConnections section](#find-featured-connections-properties). |

<a name="find-connector-id"></a>

### Find the connector ID

To find the connector ID to use for a connection in the **manifest.json** file, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Connections**.

1. Select the **JSON View** tab.

1. Based on the connection type, follow these steps:

   - For managed, "shared" connections hosted and run in Azure, find the **`managedApiConnections`** section. Under the **`connection`** attribute, copy and save the **`id`** value without any personal and sensitive data, such as the subscription ID, resource group name, and so on.

   - For service provider-based connections hosted on the Azure Logic Apps runtime, find the **`serviceProviderConnections`** section. 

<a name="find-featured-connections-operation-properties"></a>

### Find the operation properties for featuredConnections

To find the properties for other operations to use in the **`featureConnections`** section for the **manifest.json** file, follow these steps:

 , This is an array and you can specify the operation type and operation kind. You can get these values from the workflow definition file. For example, for below workflow, highlighted properties should be used 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Connections**.

1. Select the **JSON View** tab.


## Parameter and connection references in workflow.jon

### Parameter references

When you reference parameters in the **workflow.json** file, you must reflect names that use the suffix **_#workflowname#** in the following way:

**`"name": "@parameters('<parameter-name>_#workflowname#')"`**

For example:

**`"name": "@parameters('sharepoint-folder-path_#workflowname#')"`**

### Connection references

When you reference connections in the **workflow.json** file, you must reflect names that use the suffix **_#workflowname#** in the following way:

```json
"referenceName": "<connector-ID>_#workflowname*",
"connectionName": "<connector-ID>_#workflowname"
```

For example:

```json
"referenceName": "AI_search_#workflowname*",
"connectionName": "AI_search_#workflowname"
```
