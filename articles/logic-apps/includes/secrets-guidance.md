> In production environments, always protect sensitive information and secrets, such as credentials, 
> certificates, thumbprints, access keys, and connection strings. Make sure that you securely store such information 
> by using Microsoft Entra ID and [Azure Key Vault](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2300117). 
> Avoid hardcoding this information, sharing with other users, or saving in plain text anywhere others 
> can access. Rotate your secrets as soon as possible if you think this information might be compromised. 
> For more information, see [About Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview).
>
> For authentication, use [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/authentication/overview-authentication) with 
> [managed identities](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) whenever possible. 
> This method provides optimal and superior security without having to provide credentials. Azure manages 
> this identity for you and helps keep authentication information secure so that you don't have to manage 
> this sensitive information. To set up a managed identity for Azure Logic Apps, see 
> [Authenticate access and connections to Azure resources with managed identities in Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/authenticate-with-managed-identity).
