# Power Automate migration to Azure Logic Apps (Standard)

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-standard.md)]

Many development teams increasingly need to build scalable, secure, and efficient automation solutions. Perhaps your team also faces the strategic choice whether to migrate your flows in Microsoft Power Automate to Standard workflows in Azure Logic Apps. Both Power Automate and Azure Logic Apps provide powerful automation platforms and tools. However, for enterprises that run complex, high-volume, and security-sensitive workloads, Azure Logic Apps (Standard) offers many key advantages.

This guide outlines the advantages gained from transitioning to Azure Logic Apps (Standard), especially when you use the migration tool designed to support this process.

## Migration benefits

Azure Logic Apps (Standard) provides the following benefits by providing capabilities that support enterprise-level scenarios and needs. The following table lists some high-level examples:

#### Security and compliance first

Enterprises consider security a top priority, so Azure Logic Apps (Standard) provides advanced security features beyond those available in Power Automate, for example:

- Virtual network integration and private endpoints

  Run Standard workflows inside secure Azure virtual networks, which reduce exposure to the public internet through private endpoints and enhance data security.

- Microsoft Entra ID integration

  Restrict workflow access only to users and services authorized by Microsoft Entra ID.

- Managed identity authentication

  Eliminate the need to manually manage user credentials, while allowing your workflows to securely access and interact with other Azure services or resources.

- Role-based access control (RBAC)

  Minimize the risks from unauthorized access or changes by assigning granular permissions to your logic app workflows with precisely defined role-based access controls. With the logging and auditing capabilities in Azure Logic Apps, you can use audit trails to track changes and ensure compliance with security standards.

<a name="performance-scalability"></a>

#### Performance and scalability

Azure Logic Apps (Standard) is designed and built for high performance and scalable automation, which makes the platform ideal for large-scale workflows with following capabilities:

- Dedicated compute resources

  A Standard logic app resource can use one of the following hosting options:

  - Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps
  - App Service Environment (ASE) v3
  - Your own infrastructure (hybrid deployment)

  These dedicated compute resources make sure that your workflows experience stable and consistent performance.

  Elastic scaling makes on-demand automatic scaling possible for logic app workflow-related resources and capacity. This scaling optimizes costs and maintains performance even during peak loads.

- Optimized workflow execution

  By default, workflow instances run in parallel or concurrently, which reduces processing time for complex tasks. Performance optimizations for the Azure Logic Apps platform provides lower latency and faster response times.

- High throughput

  Azure Logic Apps efficiently handles high transaction volume without degrading performance as a result from having access to Azure's infrastructure.

<a name="business-continuity-disaster-recovery"></a>

#### Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR)

To make sure that workflow operations run without interruption, Azure Logic Apps provides the following comprehensive BCDR capabilities:

- Geo-redundancy

  Multi-region deployment: You can distribute logic app instances across multiple regions to ensure availability even during regional outages, which minimize downtime.

- Automated backups and restore

  Automated regular backup processes make sure that you can quickly restore workflows if failures or accident deletions happen.

- High availability

  Azure Logic Apps (Standard) includes built-in redundancy, which provides high availability to keep your workflows operational even during infrastructure failures.

<a name="integration-development"></a>

#### Integration and development

Azure Logic Apps excels at helping you integrate your workflows with a expansive range of services, systems, apps, and data and by supporting tools that help speed your development process.

- Extensive connector library

  Choose from over 1,400 Azure-hosted connectors to access cloud services, on-premises systems, apps, and other data sources. Connect even more securely to key services such as SQL Server and Azure Key Vault in a more scalable way by using built-in operations, powered by the Azure Logic Apps runtime.

- Workflow templates gallery

  Create workflows even faster by starting with prebuilt templates for commonly used workload patterns, including those for AI data processing and chat completion scenarios.

- Development tools and reusability 

  Locally create, debug, run, and manage workflows within Visual Studio Code when you use the Azure Logic Apps (Standard) extension.

  Build modular, reusable components with logic app projects in Visual Studio Code. These components help you reduce development time and make sure that you have consistency across projects.

<a name="version-control-ci-cd"></a>

#### Version control with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

Azure Logic Apps supports robust version control and automated deployment processes through CI/CD pipelines.

- Version control integration 

  Full Git integration for Visual Studio Code projects helps your team work seamlessly with Git repositories, collaborate more easily, and track changes to workflows, manage branches, and so on. Change tracking includes full version history so you can revert to previous workflow versions if necessary.

- CI/CD pipelines for safe deployment practices

  Azure Logic Apps supports automated deployments and integrates with CI/CD tools such as Azure DevOps, which faciliate consistent and less error-prone deployments across environments.

  Define and deploy your logic app workflows with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep templates (infrastructure as code) by using Azure DevOps, which provides scalable, repeatable deployments that align with DevOps practices.

## Flow migration tool

This migration tool converts a Power Automate flow into the equivalent Standard logic app workflow configuration.  The tool replicates the flow's logic "as-is", while preserving the flow's structure and functionality in Azure Logic Apps. This approach helps maintain continuity in business processes without the need for complete rework.

However, due to security constraints, the migration tool can't automatically transfer the connections used by the Power Automate flow. While the tool automates most of the flow conversion, you must manually recreate the connections in the logic app workflow. This manual step is necessary to fully meet the security protocols and compliance standards for Azure Logic Apps.

Despite this requirement, the migration tool offers significant time and resource savings by eliminating the need to manually recreate entire workflows. The tool's automated process drastically reduces any other necessary manual effort and shortens the overall migration timeline. With this automation, your team can focus energy on setting up and optmizing connections, not on rebuilding workflows.

### Migration testing and validation

To make sure that your converted flow works with the expected continuity and performance, your migration process requires thorough testing and validation:

| Quality assurance activity | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Functional testing | Make sure that migrated flows retain their original logic and produce consistent outputs. |
| Connection testing | Manually recreate connections. Follow with rigorous security and functionality testing, especially for services such as SQL Server and Azure Key Vault. |
| Security validation | Comprehensively confirm that workflows meet corporate security policies and Azure's enhanced security standards. |
| Performance testing | Make sure that high-throughput workflows exceed the performance standards for Power Automate. |
