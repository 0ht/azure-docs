# Quickstart: Create automated workflows in multitenant Azure Logic Apps with Visual Studio (Deprecated)

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The **Azure Logic Apps Tools for Visual Studio** extension is deprecated and no longer receives updates.
> To create and manage logic app workflows using a local development environment, see the following documentation:
>
> - [Quickstart: Create and manage a Consumption logic app workflow in multitenant Azure Logic Apps with Visual Studio Code](/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio-code)
>
> - [Create a Standard logic app workflow in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps with Visual Studio Code](/azure/logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code)

You can create, develop, and deploy automated workflows that integrate services, systems, apps, and data across enterprises and organizations by using [Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md). Although you can perform these tasks in the Azure portal, you can also use a local development environment to create logic app projects that you can add to source control, publish different versions, and create Azure Resource Manager templates for different deployment environments. For more information about multitenant versus single-tenant logic app workflows, see [Single-tenant versus multitenant in Azure Logic Apps](single-tenant-overview-compare.md).
