# Launch your first AI application to Azure Container Apps

This quickstart shows you how to launch your first AI application to Azure Container Apps. The article demonstrates how to deploy a sample AI chat assistant application based on the Spring PetClinic application to run on Azure Container Apps. The application uses the [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) and demonstrates how to automate deployment using the Azure Developer CLI (azd).

In this quickstart you deploy an AI-enabled application to Azure Container Apps, explore its architecture, and learn how to implement your first AI application in Azure Container Apps.

The following screenshot shows the AI assistant:

## General architecture structure

The following diagram shows the architecture of the AI application on Azure Container Apps:

:::image type="complex" source="media/first-ai-application/architecture-chart.png" alt-text="Diagram of the architecture of the AI application." lightbox="media/first-ai-application/architecture-chart.png":::
   Diagram that shows the architecture of the AI application. Users access the system through authentication managed by Entra ID. The Azure Container App environment contains an API gatewway that enables routing for and communication with the application. The API gateway uses managed identities to securely interact with the Azure Container Registry and with Azure Cognitive Services. The API gateway also handles communication with external users. A virtual network between the API gateway and external systems provides secure and isolated network connectivity.

## Prepare the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-petclinic-ai.git
```

## Deploy your first AI application

> [!NOTE]
> This template uses [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) deployment mododules **gpt-4o** and **text-embedding-ada-002** which may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#standard-deployment-model-availability) and select a region during deployment accordingly.

We recommend using region **East US**, **East US 2**, **North Central US**, **South Central US**, **Sweden Central**, **West US**, and **West US 3**.

* Log in to azd with command

  ```bash
  azd auth login
  ```

* Run command to auto deploy

  ```bash
  azd up
  ```

  Fill the variables required:

  ```
  ? Enter a new environment name: first-ai
  ? Select an Azure Subscription to use: <SUBSCRIPTION>
  ? Select an Azure location to use: <REGION>
  ```

  It takes about 15 minutes to get your first AI application ready. Sample output:

  ```

  ```

* Try the AI application

  Open the App url from the deploy output:

  ```
  INFO: Deploy finish succeed!
  INFO: App url: https://petclinic-ai.<cluster>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io
  ```

  And your can see the pet clinic page and chat with the AI assistant.

  You can get help by having a natural language chat with the AI assistant. The AI assistant can assist you with the following tasks:
  - Querying the registered pet owners
  - Adding a new pet owner
  - Updating the pet owner's information
  - Adding a new pet
  - Querying the vets' information

  Here's a sample to register a new owner with a pet to the petclinic. You can find the new owner and pet info from the owner page after the AI assistant finished the job.

  :::image type="content" source="media/first-ai-application/add-new-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of AI chat assistant adding new item.":::

  The capabilities of the AI assistant depend on the model you deploy in Azure OpenAI and the implementation of the defined functions.

* Apply your changes

  If there are some changes to the code, apply the updates to Azure with these commands:

  ```bash
  azd package
  azd deploy
  ```

## How to implement the first AI application

This sample is an AI chat assistant based on Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), it uses Spring AI SDKs to connect to Azure OpenAI service.

### Concept

Here we introduce some key concept on how to implement an AI application.

1. Spring AI
   [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) is an application framework for AI engineering. Its goal is to apply to the AI domain Spring ecosystem design principles to the AI domain.

   There's another popular AI framework [langchain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/intro), and you may find the samples in [Spring PetClinic With OpenAI and Langchain4j](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-petclinic-langchain4j).

1. RAG in Azure OpenAI

   RAG with Azure OpenAI allows developers to use supported AI chat models that can reference specific sources of information to ground the response. Adding this information allows the model to reference both the specific data provided and its pretrained knowledge to provide more effective responses.

   Azure OpenAI enables RAG by connecting pretrained models to your own data sources. Azure OpenAI on your data goes through the following steps:

   - Receive user prompt.
   - Determine relevant content and intent of the prompt.
   - Query the search index with that content and intent.
   - Insert search result chunk into the Azure OpenAI prompt, along with system message and user prompt.
   - Send entire prompt to Azure OpenAI.
   - Return response and data reference (if any) to the user.

   See more from [Spring AI Chat Client](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chatclient.html) and [Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure OpenAI Service](/training/modules/use-own-data-azure-openai).

### Code implementation

Some introduction to the code for readers to understand the flows of this first AI application.

1. The Rest Controller to talk to ChatClient
   In [PetclinicChatClient](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-petclinic-ai/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/genai/PetclinicChatClient.java), we implement the rest function `/chat`. We call the chatClient with user inputs.

   ```java
   return this.chatClient.prompt().user(u -> u.text(query)).call().content();
   ```

1. We use [ChatConfiguration](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-petclinic-ai/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/genai/ChatConfiguration.java) to customize the chatClient.

   Some key configuration of the chatClient, see function `ChatClientCustomizer`:

   - Client to connect to Azure OpenAI. Both api-key and managed identity supported.
   - ChatModel. Deployment `gpt-4o` and temperature `0.7` are set in configuration file.
   - VectorStore. The vector database stores mathematical representations of our documents, known as embeddings. The vectore data is used by the Chat API to find documents relevant to a user's question.
   - System Prompt. Customize AI behavior and enhance performance.
   - Functions. Customized functions for OpenAI to interact with business system, these functions define the AI capabilities to your business.
   - Advisors. Provides a flexible and powerful way to intercept, modify, and enhance AI-driven interactions in your Spring applications.

   ```java
   @Bean
   public ChatClientCustomizer chatClientCustomizer(VectorStore vectorStore, ChatModel model) {
       ChatMemory chatMemory = new InMemoryChatMemory();

       return b -> b.defaultSystem(systemResource)
           .defaultFunctions("listOwners", "listVets", "addPetToOwner", "addOwnerToPetclinic")
           .defaultAdvisors(new PromptChatMemoryAdvisor(chatMemory),
               new ModeledQuestionAnswerAdvisor(vectorStore, SearchRequest.defaults(), model));
   }
   ```

1. Functions

   The bean names of `java.util.Function`s defined in the application context. The functions are the interface between AI models and your business system. Here are some samples functions in [AIFunctionConfiguration](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-petclinic-ai/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/genai/AIFunctionConfiguration.java), to talk to the petclinic application.
   - The `@Description` annotations to functions help the AI models to understand the functions in a natural language.
   - The function body varies depending on your business requirements.

1. Advisors

   See more from [Spring AI advisors](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/advisors.html).

   - QuestionAnswerAdvisor. In this first AI application, we implement a [ModeledQuestionAnswerAdvisor](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-petclinic-ai/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/genai/ModeledQuestionAnswerAdvisor.java). First a call to AI models to generate a new user prompt and then use the AI-refined user prompt to retrieve again. This two-steps user prompts improve the quality of the response.
   - PromptChatMemoryAdvisor. Using this advisor we're adding chat memory into the prompt and providing a conversation history to the chat model. AI can remember the context of the chat and improve the chat quality.

Please refer to the source code for more details.

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working with subsequent tutorials, you might want to leave these resources in place. When no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the resources in the resource group. 

Two simple options to clean up the resources:

1. Use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true). Find the resource group of this sample, and delete the resource group directly.

1. Delete the resource group by using Azure CLI with the following commands:

   ```azurecli
   az group delete --name rg-first-ai
   ```
