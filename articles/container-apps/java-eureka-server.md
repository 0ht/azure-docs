# Tutorial: Connect to a managed Eureka Server for Spring in Azure Container Apps

Eureka Server for Spring is a service registry that allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services. Available as an Azure Container Apps component, you can bind your container app to a Eureka Server for Spring for automatic registration with the Eureka server.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Eureka Server for Spring Java component
> * Bind your container app to Eureka Server for Spring Java component

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial uses services that can affect your Azure bill. If you decide to follow along step-by-step, make sure you delete the resources featured in this article to avoid unexpected billing.

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you need the following items:

| Requirement  | Instructions |
|--|--|
| Azure account | An active subscription is required. If you don't have one, you [can create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). |
| Azure CLI | Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).|

## Considerations

When running in Eureka Server for Spring in Azure Container Apps, be aware of the following details:

| Item | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | The Eureka Server for Spring component runs in the same environment as the connected container app. |
| **Scaling** | The Eureka Server for Spring canâ€™t scale. The scaling properties `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` are both set to `1`. To achieve high availability, you can refer to [Create a Highly Available Eureka Service in Azure Container Apps](java-eureka-server-highly-available.md).|
| **Resources** | The container resource allocation for Eureka Server for Spring is fixed. The number of the CPU cores is 0.5, and the memory size is 1Gi. |
| **Pricing** | The Eureka Server for Spring billing falls under consumption-based pricing. Resources consumed by managed Java components are billed at the active/idle rates. You can delete components that are no longer in use to stop billing. |
| **Binding** | Container apps connect to a Eureka Server for Spring component via a binding. The bindings inject configurations into container app environment variables. Once a binding is established, the container app can read the configuration values from environment variables and connect to the Eureka Server for Spring. |

## Setup

Before you begin to work with the Eureka Server for Spring, you first need to create the required resources.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Execute the following commands to create your resource group, container apps environment.

1. Create variables to support your application configuration. These values are provided for you for the purposes of this lesson.

    ```bash
    export LOCATION=eastus
    export RESOURCE_GROUP=my-services-resource-group
    export ENVIRONMENT=my-environment
    export EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME=eureka
    export APP_NAME=my-eureka-client
    export IMAGE="mcr.microsoft.com/javacomponents/samples/sample-service-eureka-client:latest"
    ```

    | Variable | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `LOCATION` | The Azure region location where you create your container app and Java component. |
    | `ENVIRONMENT` | The Azure Container Apps environment name for your demo application. |
    | `RESOURCE_GROUP` | The Azure resource group name for your demo application. |
    | `EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME` | The name of the Java component created for your container app. In this case, you create a Eureka Server for Spring Java component.  |
    | `IMAGE` | The container image used in your container app. |

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Create a resource group.

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
    ```

1. Create your container apps environment.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env create \
      --name $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --location $LOCATION
    ```

## Create the Eureka Server for Spring Java component

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Now that you have an existing environment, you can create your container app and bind it to a Java component instance of Eureka Server for Spring.

1. Create the Eureka Server for Spring Java component.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env java-component eureka-server-for-spring create \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME
    ```

1. Optional: Update the Eureka Server for Spring Java component configuration.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env java-component eureka-server-for-spring update \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME 
      --configuration eureka.server.renewal-percent-threshold=0.85 eureka.server.eviction-interval-timer-in-ms=10000
    ```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Now that you have an existing environment and eureka client container app, you can create a Java component instance of Eureka Server for Spring.

1. Go to your container app's environment in the portal.

1. From the left menu, under *Services* category, select **Services**.

1. Select **+ Configure** drop down, and select **Java component**.

1. In the *Configure Java component* panel, enter the following values.

  | Property | Value |
  |---|---|
  | **Java component type** | Select **Eureka Server for Spring**. |
  | **Java component name** | Enter **eureka**. |

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the *Review* tab, select **Configure**.

## Bind your container app to the Eureka Server for Spring Java component

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Create the container app and bind to the Eureka Server for Spring.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp create \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --image $IMAGE \
      --min-replicas 1 \
      --max-replicas 1 \
      --ingress external \
      --target-port 8080 \
      --bind $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME \
      --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn
    ```

Copy the URL of your app to a text editor so you can use it in a coming step.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to your container app environment in the portal.

1. From the left menu, under *Services* category, select **Services**.

1. From the list, select **eureka**.

1. Under *bindings, select the *App name* drop-down and select  **my-eureka-client**.

1. Select the **Review** tab.

1. Select the **Configure** button.

1. Return to your container app in the portal and copy the URL of your app to a text editor so you can use it in a coming step.

---

Return to the container app in the portal and copy the URL of your app to a text editor so you can use it in a coming step.

Navigate to the `/allRegistrationStatus` route to view all applications registered with the Eureka Server for Spring.

The binding injects several configurations into the application as environment variables, primarily the `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone` property. This property indicates the internal endpoint of the Eureka Server Java component.

The binding also injects the following properties:

```bash
"eureka.client.register-with-eureka":    "true"
"eureka.client.fetch-registry":          "true"
"eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address":     "true"
```

The `eureka.client.register-with-eureka` property is set to `true` to enforce registration with the Eureka server. This registration overwrites the local setting in `application.properties`, from the config server and so on. If you want to set it to `false`, you can overwrite it by setting an environment variable in your container app.

The `eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address` is set to `true` due to the specific DNS resolution rule in the container app environment. Don't modify this value so you don't break the binding.

## (Optional) Unbind your container app from the Eureka Server for Spring Java component

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To remove a binding from a container app, use the `--unbind` option.

  ``` azurecli
    az containerapp update \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --unbind $JAVA_COMPONENT_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
  ```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to your container app environment in the portal.

1. From the left menu, under *Services* category, select **Services**.

1. From the list, select **eureka**.

1. Under *Bindings*, find the line for *my-eureka-client* select and select **Delete**.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select the **Review** tab.

1. Select the **Configure** button.

## View the application through a dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To view the dashboard, you need to have at least the `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/write` role assigned to your account on the managed environment resource. You can either explicitly assign `Owner` or `Contributor` role on the resource or follow the steps to create a custom role definition and assign it to your account.

1. Create the custom role definition.

    ```azurecli
    az role definition create --role-definition '{
        "Name": "<YOUR_ROLE_NAME>",
        "IsCustom": true,
        "Description": "Can access managed Java Component dashboards in managed environments",
        "Actions": [
            "Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/write"
        ],
        "AssignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"]
    }'
    ```

    Make sure to replace placeholder in between the `<>` brackets in the `AssignableScopes` value with your subscription ID.

1. Assign the custom role to your account on managed environment resource.

    Get the resource ID of the managed environment:

    ```azurecli
        export ENVIRONMENT_ID=$(az containerapp env show \
         --name $ENVIRONMENT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ 
         --query id -o tsv)
    ```

1. Assign the role to your account.

    Before running this command, replace the placeholder in between the `<>` brackets with your user or service principal ID.

    ```azurecli
    az role assignment create \
      --assignee <USER_OR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID> \
      --role "<ROLE_NAME>" \
      --scope $ENVIRONMENT_ID
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > <USER_OR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID> usually should be the identity that you use to access Azure Portal. <ROLE_NAME> is the name you assigned in step 1.

1. Get the URL of the Eureka Server for Spring dashboard.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env java-component eureka-server-for-spring show \
      --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME \
      --query properties.ingress.fqdn -o tsv
    ```

    This command returns the URL you can use to access the Eureka Server for Spring dashboard. Through the dashboard, your container app is also to you as shown in the following screenshot.

  :::image type="content" source="media/java-components/eureka-alone.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Eureka Server for Spring dashboard."  lightbox="media/java-components/eureka-alone.png":::

## Optional: Integrate the Eureka Server for Spring and Admin for Spring Java components

If you want to integrate the Eureka Server for Spring and the Admin for Spring Java components, see [Integrate the managed Admin for Spring with Eureka Server for Spring](java-admin-eureka-integration.md).

## Clean up resources

The resources created in this tutorial have an effect on your Azure bill. If you aren't going to use these services long-term, run the following command to remove everything created in this tutorial.

```azurecli
az group delete \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

## Allowed configuration list for your Eureka Server for Spring

The following list details supported configurations. You can find more details in [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/html/#spring-cloud-eureka-server).

> [!NOTE]
> Please submit support tickets for new feature requests.

### Configuration options

The `az containerapp update` command uses the `--configuration` parameter to control how the Eureka Server for Spring is configured. You can use multiple parameters at once as long as they're separated by a space. You can find more details in [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/html/#spring-cloud-eureka-server) docs.

The following configuration settings are available on the `eureka.server` configuration property.

| Name | Description | Default value |
|--|--|--|
| `eureka.server.enable-self-preservation` | When enabled, the server keeps track of the number of renewals it should receive from the server. Any time, the number of renewals drops below the threshold percentage as defined by eureka.server.renewal-percent-threshold. The default value is set to `true` in the original Eureka server, but in the Eureka Server Java component, the default value is set to `false`. See [Limitations of Eureka Server for Spring Java component](#limitations)  | false |
| `eureka.server.renewal-percent-threshold`| The minimum percentage of renewals that is expected from the clients in the period specified by eureka.server.renewal-threshold-update-interval-ms. If the renewals drop below the threshold, the expirations are disabled if the eureka.server.enable-self-preservation is enabled. | 0.85 |
| `eureka.server.renewal-threshold-update-interval-ms` | The interval with which the threshold as specified in eureka.server.renewal-percent-threshold needs to be updated. | 0 |
| `eureka.server.expected-client-renewal-interval-seconds` | The interval with which clients are expected to send their heartbeats. Defaults to 30 seconds. If clients send heartbeats with different frequency, say, every 15 seconds, then this parameter should be tuned accordingly, otherwise, self-preservation won't work as expected. | 30 |
| `eureka.server.response-cache-auto-expiration-in-seconds`| Gets the time for which the registry payload should be kept in the cache if it is not invalidated by change events. | 180|
| `eureka.server.response-cache-update-interval-ms` | Gets the time interval with which the payload cache of the client should be updated.| 0 |
| `eureka.server.use-read-only-response-cache`| The com.netflix.eureka.registry.ResponseCache currently uses a two level caching strategy to responses. A readWrite cache with an expiration policy, and a readonly cache that caches without expiry.| true |
| `eureka.server.disable-delta`| Checks to see if the delta information can be served to client or not. | false |
| `eureka.server.retention-time-in-m-s-in-delta-queue`| Get the time for which the delta information should be cached for the clients to retrieve the value without missing it.| 0 |
| `eureka.server.delta-retention-timer-interval-in-ms` | Get the time interval with which the clean up task should wake up and check for expired delta information. | 0 |
| `eureka.server.eviction-interval-timer-in-ms` | Get the time interval with which the task that expires instances should wake up and run.| 60000|
| `eureka.server.sync-when-timestamp-differs` | Checks whether to synchronize instances when timestamp differs. | true |
| `eureka.server.rate-limiter-enabled` | Indicates whether the rate limiter should be enabled or disabled. | false |
| `eureka.server.rate-limiter-burst-size`  | Rate limiter, token bucket algorithm property. | 10 |
| `eureka.server.rate-limiter-registry-fetch-average-rate`| Rate limiter, token bucket algorithm property. Specifies the average enforced request rate. | 500 |
| `eureka.server.rate-limiter-privileged-clients` | A list of certified clients. This is in addition to standard eureka Java clients. | N/A |
| `eureka.server.rate-limiter-throttle-standard-clients` | Indicate if rate limit standard clients. If set to false, only non standard clients will be rate limited. | false |
| `eureka.server.rate-limiter-full-fetch-average-rate` | Rate limiter, token bucket algorithm property. Specifies the average enforced request rate. | 100 |

### Common configurations

- logging related configurations
  - [**logging.level.***](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.13.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-logging.html#boot-features-custom-log-levels) 
  - [**logging.group.***](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.13.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-logging.html#boot-features-custom-log-groups)
  - Any other configurations under logging.* namespace should be forbidden, for example, writing log files by using `logging.file` should be forbidden.

## Call between applications

This example shows you how to write Java code to call between applications registered with the Eureka Server for Spring component. When container apps are bound with Eureka, they communicate with each other through the Eureka server.

The example creates two applications, a caller and a callee. Both applications communicate among each other using the Eureka Server for Spring component. The callee application exposes an endpoint that is called by the caller application.

1. Create the callee application. Enable the Eureka client in your Spring Boot application by adding the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation to your main class.

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    @EnableDiscoveryClient
    public class CalleeApplication {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CalleeApplication.class, args);
      }
    }
    ````

1. Create an endpoint in the callee application that is called by the caller application.

    ```java
    @RestController
    public class CalleeController {
    
        @GetMapping("/call")
        public String calledByCaller() {
            return "Hello from Application callee!";
        }
    }
    ```

1. Set the callee application's name in the application configuration file. For example, *application.yml*.

    ```yaml
    spring.application.name=callee
    ```

1. Create the caller application.

    Add the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation to enable Eureka client functionality. Also, create a `WebClient.Builder` bean with the `@LoadBalanced` annotation to perform load-balanced calls to other services.

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    @EnableDiscoveryClient
    public class CallerApplication {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CallerApplication.class, args);
      }
    
      @Bean
      @LoadBalanced
      public WebClient.Builder loadBalancedWebClientBuilder() {
        return WebClient.builder();
      }
    }
    ```

1. Create a controller in the caller application that uses the `WebClient.Builder` to call the callee application using its application name, callee.

    ```java
    @RestController
    public class CallerController { 
        @Autowired
        private WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder;
     
        @GetMapping("/call-callee")
        public Mono<String> callCallee() {
            return webClientBuilder.build()
                .get()
                .uri("http://callee/call")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class);
        }
    }
    ```

Now you have a caller and callee application that communicate with each other using Eureka Server for Spring Java components. Make sure both applications are running and bind with the Eureka server before testing the `/call-callee` endpoint in the caller application.

## Limitations

- The Eureka Server Java component comes with a default configuration, `eureka.server.enable-self-preservation`, set to `false`. This default configuration helps avoid times when instances aren't deleted after self-preservation is enabled. If instances are deleted too early, some requests might be directed to nonexistent instances. If you want to change this setting to `true`, you can overwrite it by setting your own configurations in the Java component.
