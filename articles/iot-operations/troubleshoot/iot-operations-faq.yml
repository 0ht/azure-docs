title: Azure IoT Operations frequently asked questions
summary: |
  This article provides a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Azure IoT Operations and their answers.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
    - question: |
         What are the hardware requirements?
      answer: For more information on hardware requirements, see [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes system requirements](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/system-requirements).
    - question: |
         Is message persistence supported?
      answer: At Azure IoT Operations general availability (GA), full message persistence won't be supported. The capability is planned for post-GA.
    - question: |
         Does Azure IoT Operations offer high availability and zero data loss features at general availability?
      answer: Azure IoT Operations workloads on K3s and HCI/Aks-Arc multi-node clusters should support distribution of Azure IoT Operations workloads across multi-nodes setups taking advantage of fault tolerance and Kubernetes scheduling of pods across nodes. The features are planned for general availability.
    - question: |
         Can I migrate my IoT Edge workloads to Azure IoT Operations?
      answer: Currently, there's no documented migration path from IoT Edge to Azure IoT Operations. However, some targeted migration is planned, so if you have any feature asks for Azure IoT Operations as part of any migration you're planning to do, we ask that you relay this back to us.
    - question: |
         Can I just upgrade my preview version to the general availability version?
      answer: No, you won't be able to upgrade from the preview to the general availability version directly. You'll need to redeploy. Upgrade scenario is planned post-GA.
    - question: |
         What Kubernetes distros are compatible with Azure IoT Operations?
      answer: Azure IoT Operations is only officially supported on two platforms now Ubuntu+K3s, Windows IoT + AKS EE. For more information, see [Prepare your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-prepare-cluster.md). We're adding support for Stack HCI 23H2 + AKS Hybrid. The rest of the platform combinations are planned to be supported by general availability.
    - question: |
         For IoT Operations, which device communication protocols are going to be supported out-of-the-box in general availability?
      answer: At general availability, we plan to support OPC UA and MQTT. There are many devices and protocol bridges that exist in-market to enable customers to connect much of the existing device ecosystem via these two protocols. After general availability, we plan to add ONVIF and Media Stream support [Camera use cases] and enable a third-party ecosystem to allow ISVs (or other Microsoft teams) to build pluggable protocols for other environments like medical, etc.
    - question: |
         Is there a non-Dapr Azure IoT Operations state store code example?
      answer: |
        Currently, we don't have an example/asset for external use. However, the StateStore documentation can help you understand how it can be used. For more information, see [MQTT broker state store protocol](../create-edge-apps/concept-about-state-store-protocol.md) For an SDK, there's an upcoming Akri and MQTT broker SDK that simplifies using StateStore, currently only in .NET. This won't be available until Azure IoT Operations is in general availability later this year. The [SDKs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/explore-akri-sdk/) are initially available in Rust, Go, and .NET.
    - question: |
         MQTT with QOS 2. Is this in the roadmap for IoT Operations MQ
      answer: For Azure IoT Operations, it is on the backlog but not prioritized yet. QoS 2 won't be supported in the initial Azure IoT Operations general availability.
    - question: |
         Which Azure regions is Azure IoT Operations currently available in?
      answer: Azure IoT Operations is available in East US2, West US 3, West Europe, East US, West US, West US 2, North Europe regions. We plan to add support for Taiwan, Japan, EU, and China later.
    - question: |
         Is there a way to gracefully fail over between two redundant OPC UA servers in case one of them fails? The idea is to have minimal/zero data loss and no reconfiguration effort.
      answer: Yes, we have this as a feature on our roadmap for Azure IoT Operations post-GA.
    - question: |
         Is there a hard limit on the sampling intervals for OPC UA tags for minimum and maximum sampling interval?
      answer: The minimum is 1ms, however there's no upper restriction imposed at the connector level
  - name: Pricing
    questions:
    - question: |
         Does Azure IoT Operations offer a free trial?
      answer: Currently, No.
    - question: |
         What is the cost involved in using Azure IoT Operations?
      answer: We're currently working on pricing.
