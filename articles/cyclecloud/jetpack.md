# Jetpack

When a virtual machine is provisioned to become a node in a cluster, Jetpack is automatically installed when using Azure CycleCloud. Jetpack is required on every node of a cluster, as it provides three main functions:

* Node Configuration

Azure CycleCloud uses [Chef](https://www.chef.io) to automate the configuration of a provisioned VM into a working cluster node. A Chef client is embedded within Jetpack, and the Chef cookbooks needed for the configuration of the node are downloaded by Jetpack.

* Distributed Synchronization

Jetpack manages communication between the node and the Azure CycleCloud application server, which enables CycleCloud to monitor the status of the provisioning VMs and synchronize the orchestration of multiple nodes in the cluster.

* HeathCheck

Jetpack runs [HealthCheck](healthcheck.md) on VMs, and terminates them if they are unhealthy.

## Jetpack Installation

When you first start a cluster using Azure CycleCloud, the software fetches the jetpack installer and caches it into a locker in your Azure Storage Account. When the VMs in the cluster are provisioned, a [custom script extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/overview) is executed as part of the boot process. This will download the Jetpack installer from your locker cache and install it on the VM.

## Jetpack Install Location
All Jetpack files are installed inside a singular directory tree:

* Windows: `C:\cycle\jetpack`
* Linux: `/opt/cycle/Jetpack`

In addition to creating this directory, the Jetpack installer:

  * Creates system init startup scripts which configure a VM as a cluster
    node
  * Creates udev rules on Linux
  * Installs the [HealthCheck](healthcheck.md) service
  * Sets the environment variable `CYCLECLOUD_HOME`

### Jetpack Subdirectories

| Directory | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bin`     | Useful binaries and scripts.                                                                                                                                              |
| `config`  | User defined and cluster defined configuration files and scripts.                                                                                                         |
| `logs`    | Logs generated by joining a cluster and converging the node, of particular interest is the *chef-client.log* which contains the results from converging Chef recipes. |
| `system`  | Internal files. We don't recommend directly using or accessing any files in this directory as they will change significantly from release to release.                     |


## HealthCheck

The HealthCheck service executes user-defined scripts to determine a VM's
current viability as a cluster node. Scripts may be written in Python or be
Bash (Linux) or batch (Windows) scripts. If the script exits with a code of 254,
the VM will be terminated. Other non-zero return codes are treated as
unknown and are logged to CycleCloud. Checks are stored in
`/opt/cycle/jetpack/config/healthcheck.d` on Linux and in
`C:\cycle\jetpack\config\healthcheck.d` on Windows.

To delay a HealthCheck related termination, use the `jetpack keepalive` command.

## Jetpack Command Line Tool

The **Jetpack** command-line tool, located at `/opt/cycle/jetpack/bin/jetpack`
or `C:\cycle\jetpack\bin\jetpack`, provides a useful set of subcommands for
manipulating the current VM and interacting with Azure CycleCloud.

| Command             | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jetpack config`    | Retrieve a configuration value.                          |
| `jetpack converge`  | Execute a Chef converge.                                 |
| `jetpack keepalive` | Delay system termination by the HealthCheck Service.     |
| `jetpack log`       | Log a message to CycleCloud cluster UI.                  |
| `jetpack send`      | Send an arbitrary AMQP message to the CycleCloud server. |

## Jetpack Subcommands

## jetpack config

`jetpack config` is used to fetch information passed into a VM by Azure
CycleCloud. It exposes all the system properties made available via
[Ohai](https://docs.getchef.com/ohai.html), a subset of the VM's [Azure metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service), and information about the parent CycleCloud cluster.

## jetpack converge

`jetpack converge` downloads all CycleCloud Project (TODO: include link to CycleCloud
project) Chef cookbooks and cluster-init scripts associated with the node, and
starts a Chef converge process that runs all the Chef recipes and cluster-init
scripts for the node.

## jetpack keepalive

`jetpack keepalive` interacts with the HealthCheck service to delay the termination of
the VM due to a failing HealthCheck. Termination can be delayed for a fixed
period or indefinitely. By default, termination is delayed for one hour.

To delay system termination by one hour:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack keepalive
```

To disable the HealthCheck service entirely, i.e. delay termination
indefinitely:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack keepalive forever
```

To delay system termination by six hours:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack keepalive 6h
```

## jetpack log

`jetpack log` sends a log message back to CycleCloud. The message will appear in
application server log (typically `/opt/cycle_server/cycle_server.log`), the
main event log, and the Cluster UI page.

Each message has two properties: *level* and *priority*.

The *level* property indicates the type of message. Valid levels are 'info', 'warn', and 'error'. The
level does not indicate importance of a given message - for example, some errors
are trivial and some informational messages critical.

Priority indicates the importance of the message. Valid *priority* values are 'low', 'medium', and
'high'. Only messages with a priority of medium or higher are displayed on the
Cluster UI page to avoid flooding the page with low priority messages.

To send an informational log message that will appear on the Cluster UI page:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack log 'system is now ready'
```

To send a low priority log message that you do not want to appear on the Cluster
UI page:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack log 'system is now ready' --priority low
```

By default, messages with a level of *error* have a high priority. To send an
error message:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack log 'the machine cannot process jobs' --level error
```

To send a trivial error message:

```azurecli-interactive
jetpack log 'the machine cannot process jobs' --level error --priority low
```

## jetpack send

`jetpack send` is an advanced command that you can use to send an arbitrary AMQP message
to CycleCloud. It is most useful if you have created a CycleCloud plugin that
can process that information.

You can send arbitrary strings or files with specified AMQP routing keys.
