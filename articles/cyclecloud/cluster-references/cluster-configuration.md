# Cluster Configuration

Configuration objects are rank 3, and subordinate to `node`. The configuration object define the configurable properties for the configuration code that runs on the nodes and CycleCloud Project configurations.

## Object Attributes

Configuration object attributes behave like other objects, but are extended
to provide nested definitions. Internally, the configuration sections are merged,
so there can be an arbitrary number of sections.

No quotes are necessary for strings or for boolean expressions, true or false.

``` ini
[[[configuraton my-project]]]
Attribute1 = Value1
Attribute2 = Value2
KeyAttribute3.Attribute3 = true

[[[configuraton cyclecloud.mounts.mount1]]]
Attribute1 = Value1
```

## Supported Configurations

CycleCloud supports a number of default configuration objects. These supported
objects are contained under the name `cyclecloud`.

### `[[[configuration cyclecloud]]]`

CycleCloud supports the parameterized configuration of many system services.

| Attribute | Type          | Description                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maintenance_converge.enabled  | Boolean | CycleCloud nodes are reconfigured every 20 minutes to ensure they are in the correct state. There are times when you may not want this to be the default behavior such as when you are manually testing and updating the configuration on a node. Setting this value to false will make the node configure itself only once. Default is true |
| timezone       | String                     | The timezone for a node can be changed by setting this attribute to any valid timezone string, for example “PST”, “EST”, . Default: “UTC”                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ntp.servers      | String               | A list of NTP servers to use. Default: “pool.ntp.org”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| keepalive.timeout   | Integer        | The amount of time in seconds to keep a node “alive” if it has not finished installing/configuring software. Default: 14400 (4 hours).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| discoverable        | Boolean          | Whether or not this node can be “discovered” (searched for) by other nodes started by CycleCloud. Default is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| autoscale.forced_shutdown_timeout  | Integer   | The amount of time (in minutes) before a forced shutdown occurs if autoscale cannot scale the node down successfully. Default: 15                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| security.limits       | Integer       | Linux only. The limits to apply to the node. Domain, type, and item can be specified for any [valid value](https://linux.die.net/man/5/limits.conf) defined. Defaults: security.limits.*.hard.nofile = 524288 and security.limits.*.soft.nofile = 1048576                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| mounts.     | Nested          | For [NFS exporting and mounting](~/storage-nfs-mounts.md) and volume mounting.                                                                                                                                                        |
| selinux.policy     | String       | 	Linux only. Add "selinux.policy = permissive" to your configuration to bypass an enforced selinux policy for custom images. Already disabled on core CycleCloud images.                                                                                                                                                          |

### `[[[configuration cyclecloud.mounts]]]`

A significant subdomain of the cyclecloud configuration is mounts. Each named
mount section corresponds to an entry in `/etc/fstab`.

An example of a mount section named `primary`.

``` ini
  [[[configuration cyclecloud.mounts.primary]]]
    type = nfs
    mountpoint = /usr/share/lsf
    export_path = /mnt/raid/lsf
    options = hard,proto=tcp,mountproto=tcp,retry=30,actimeo=3600,nolock
    address = 10.0.0.14
```

> [!NOTE]
> The mount section name correlates to the `mount` attribute of a `[[[volume]]]` object.

| Attribute | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type    | String  | *REQUIRED* The type attribute must be set to `nfs` for all NFS exports to differentiate from volume mounts and other shared filesystem types.                  |
| export_path   | String  | The location of the export on the NFS filer.  If an export_path is not specified, the  mountpoint of the mount will be used as the export_path.                |
| mountpoint   | String  | The location where the filesystem will be mounted after any additional configuration is applied.  If the directory does not already exist, it will be created. |
| cluster_name  | String | The name of the CycleCloud cluster which exports the filesystem.  If not set, the node's local cluster is assumed.                                             |
| address     | String   | The explicit hostname or IP address of the filesystem.  If not set, search will attempt to find the filesystem in a CycleCloud cluster.                        |
| options     | String   | Any non-default options to use when mounting the filesystem.                                                                                                   |
| disabled    | Boolean   | If set to `true`, the node will not mount the filesystem.                                                                                                      || Option
| raid_level    | Integer         | The type of RAID configuration to use when multiple devices/volumes are being used. Defaults to a value of 0, meaning RAID0, but other raid levels can be used such as 1 or 10.|
| raid_device_symlink | String  | When a raid device is created, specifying this attribute will create a symbolic link to the raid device. By default, this attribute is not set and therefore no symlink is created. This should be set in cases where you need access to the underlying raid device.                                     |
| devices       | String (list)        | This is a list of devices that should compose the mountpoint. In general, this parameter shouldn’t need to be specified (as CycleCloud will set this for you based on [[[volume]]] sections), but you can manually specify the devices if so desired.                                                    |
| vg_name     | String    | Devices are configured on Linux using the Logical Volume Manager (LVM). The volume group name will be automatically assigned, but in cases where a specific name is used, this attribute can be set. The default is set to `cyclecloud-vgX`, where X is an automatically assigned number.                  |
| lv_name      | String    | Devices are configured on Linux using the Logical Volume Manager (LVM). This value is automatically assigned and does not need specification, but if you want to use a custom logical volume name, it can be specified using this attribute. Defaults to `lv0`.                                            |
| order       | Integer    | By specifying an order, you can control the order in which mountpoints are mounted. The default order value for all mountpoints is 1000, except for ‘ephemeral’ which is 0 (ephemeral is always mounted first by default). You can override this behaviour on a case-by-case basis as needed.            |
| encryption.bits   | Integer   | The number of bits to use when encrypting the filesystem. Standard values are `128` or `256` bit AES encryption. This value is required if encryption is desired.                                                                                                                                             |
| encryption.key     | String   | The encryption key to use when encrypting the filesystem. If omitted, a random 2048 bit key will be generated. The automatically generated key is useful for when you are encrypting disks that do not persist between reboots (e.g. encrypting ephemeral devices).                                      |
| encryption.name    | String     | The name of the encrypted filesystem, used when saving encryption keys. Defaults to `cyclecloud_cryptX`, where X is an automatically generated number.                                                                                                                                                     |
| encryption.key_path   | String    | The location of the file the key will be written on disk to. Defaults to `/root/cyclecloud_cryptX.key`, where X is a automatically generated number.                                                                                                                                                       |

### `[[[configuration cyclecloud.exports]]]`

Similar to mounts, CycleCloud nodes can be configured as NFS servers if the server
recipe is enabled. Export section corresponds to /etc/exports entry.

An example of using exports with an export object name `nfs_data`:

``` ini
[[[configuration cyclecloud.exports.nfs_data]]]
type = nfs
export_path = /mnt/exports/nfs_data
writable = false
```

| Attribute | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

| export_path   | String  | The local path to export as an NFS filesystem.  If the directory does not exist already, it will be created.                                            |
| owner     | String    | The user account that should own the exported directory.                                                                                                |
| group     | String    | The group of the user that should own the exported directory.                                                                                           |
| mode      | String    | The default filesystem permissions on the exported directory.                                                                                           |
| network     | String  | The network interface on which the directory is exported.  Defaults to all: `*`.                                                                        |
| sync      | Boolean   | Synchronous/asynchronous export option.  Defaults to `true`.                                                                                            |
| writable    | Boolean  | The ro/rw export option for the filesystem. Defaults to `true`.                                                                                         |
| options     | String     | Any non-default options to use when exporting the filesystem.                                                                                           |
