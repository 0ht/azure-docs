# Cloud Provider Setup

CycleCloud supports Microsoft Azure (az), Google Cloud (gc), and Amazon
Web Services (AWS). You will need to configure your cloud provider
account for CycleCloud by generating access credentials, configuring
network settings, and enabling certain services. CycleCloud uses the
credentials you provide to provision infrastructure.

To begin, click on **Clusters** in the top menu bar. A notice will
appear that you currently do not have a cloud provider set up.
