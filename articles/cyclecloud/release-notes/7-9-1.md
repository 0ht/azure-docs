# CycleCloud version 7.9.1

The patch release improves the BeeGFS support.

## New Features:
 * BeeGFS cluster type upgraded to enable NVMe SSDs on Ls_v2 VMs.
 * Stopping a BeeGFS cluster with managed disks is now supported.

## Resolved Issues:
 * PBSpro nodes would occasionally fail initial converge due to hostname mismatch.
 * Cluster names containing spaces and other symbols would cause Jetpack installation failures.
 * Nodes that were deallocated would incorrectly show "Awaiting system boot-up" after being re-allocated.
 * Some cluster types would not automatically include inferred GridEngine and HTCondor projects.
 * Terminating and restarting Slurm clusters did not work properly when installing Slurm on a persistent disk
 * Slurm jobs failed to run due to `RealMemory` being set too high for some VM sizes
 * The "Host unreachable" message in the UI was not cleared properly when network connectivity is restored
 * The displayed node hostnames did not always match the VM hostnames
 * The HTTP Proxy settings form did not properly show the HTTPS proxy host
 * An unexpected error while collecting pricing data would cause Azure monitoring to fail
 * Dynamically created node arrays did not inherit the additional cluster-init specs of their parent
 * The BeeGFS client install was not working for HPC images
