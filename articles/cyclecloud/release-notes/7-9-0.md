# CycleCloud version 7.9.0

This release adds IBM Spectrum LSF as a cluster type. This release also added a number of features that improved error reporting, self-supportability, and make it easier to build and debug MPI applications. 

## New Features:
 * The node display now includes detailed information on preparation and configuration issues
 * The cluster summary now displays issues encountered during node preparation and configuration
 * New nodes can be added to a placement group from the web interface
 * Nodes now have a "Keep-Alive" feature to prevent them from being accidentally terminated
 * Ephemeral OS disks for virtual machines and scale sets are now supported
 * Cluster owners with an SSH key in their profile can now ssh as the `cyclecloud` user
 * CycleCloud now includes IBM Spectrum LSF as a cluster type
 * Subnets, vnets, and VMs are now shown on the Accounts page
 * Information on Infiniband support is included in the user interface and REST API
 * A node's placement group is now more prominently displayed in the UI
 * CycleCloud now shows problems with nodes connecting back to CycleCloud on startup
 * Nodes can get their node name and ID from the `jetpack` command
 * Jetpack version can now be determined on the VM via the Python API
 * Nodes must be terminated before they can be removed from a cluster
 * Active Directory authentication now supports 'user@domain.com' logins

## Resolved Issues:
 * Server commands such as `cycle_server start/stop` would print out a stack trace on some versions of Ubuntu
 * Hv1 "promo" machine types now use the same HPC CentOS image as the Hv1 machine types
 * The Nodearray `CoreCount` attribute is now the autoscaling factor
 * Changes to the low priority VM checkbox sometimes failed to save in the UI
 * MPI nodes with public IPs could cause "Scaleset attributes do not match" errors
 * SSH keys that contained newlines would cause login errors
 * Invalid Azure password errors are no longer cryptically reported as "No JSON object could be decoded"
 * Certain subscriptions which do not support querying for price information no longer cause errors
 * Requesting a new certificate from Let's Encrypt would fail due to a deprecated protocol
 * Adding and then immediately removing a node from a cluster would cause an error
 * PBS head nodes occasionally had transient software installation failures
 * There was a race condition between user management and scheduler start up
 * In some cases, the managed users for a node would not be configured before the node started running jobs
 * Jetpack converge cron used an incorrect output redirect
 * Nodes booted without Jetpack installed caused a `NullPointerException`
 * The `cyclecloud initialize` command did not work with the HTTP port on sites with HTTPS
 * The "new cluster" dialog box included a Next button even without a next page
 * GridEngine autoscale occasionally spawned errors related to trying to resize previously deleted ScaleSets.
 * Nodes being reimaged could not be terminated until the reimage process completed
 * Execute nodes that were terminating could remain around after the VM is deleted
 * Terminating nodes in a placement group would be removed before the VM finished deleting
 * Force password reset option was not working properly
 * Nodes became unselected after performing an action on them
 * Removed forced upgrade of glib2 in support of ganglia
 * Node IDs were regenerated if a cluster was reimported
 * The `cyclecloud connect` command threw an error when using an SSH bastion without a private key
 * Azure Portal hyperlinks to scaleset VMs were broken
 * VMs could not be deleted if they were started with data disks
 * Removing a previously added cluster-init via the UI did not work properly
 * Adding nodes to a scaleset after one failed would make the failed node appear successful in the UI
 * The `jetpack shutdown` command did not support deallocate
 * HB60rs_v2 VMs are were not properly filtered as an "HPC" VM type
 * Adding/removing Slurm execute nodes manually is now disallowed since they would not be able to run jobs
 * 'Off' nodes were incorrectly counting against available quota
 * Region OutOfCapacity errors during Node orchestration sometimes resulted Nodes showing a LIST of MachineTypes and blocked further autoscaling
 * BeeGFS storage nodes removed on termination
 * The `cyclecloud connect` command printed out a warning about modifying known_hosts when it did not modify this file
 * Users on a node could not be managed after that node was rebooted
 * Corrected "stack level too deep (SystemStackError)" crash on CentOS 6
 * The default heap size for the CycleCloud web server is now 4GB
 * Updated dependencies to address following CVE issues: 2012-0881, 2014-0107, 2014-0114, 2015-7501, 2016-3092, 2017-15708, 2018-14720, 2018-16492, 2019-10744, 2019-10746, 2019-14379

## Deprecated:
 * Removed Gluster-based cluster type
