# Release Notes

This production release adds support for Windows full disk encryption and stopping (deallocating) nodes from the UI. In addition, it includes a large number of accessibility improvements and fixes a number of issues.

## New Features:
 * Windows full disk encryption is now supported
 * Nodes can be stopped (deallocated) and restarted from the UI
 * CycleCloud now uses a dedicated SSL channel for management traffic from nodes
 * Accessibility fixes and improvements to the UI
 * The user interface now supports custom theming and branding
 * Volumes may now be flagged with `Disabled = true` in cluster templates
 * Clusters, VMs and scale sets now have direct links to the Azure Portal
 * CycleCloud now supports HTTP/2 when native connector is enabled

## Resolved Issues:
 * Clusters page would sometimes fail to refresh
 * Switching from HTTP to HTTPS could sometimes cause a login redirect loop
 * Overriding parameters with `-P` did not handle non-strings
 * Azure reference data was not refreshed on application start up
 * Evictions of low-priority VMs appear in the event log
 * Slurm master nodes would fail to configure when using a very large subnet
 * CLI wouldn't handle certificate verification properly
 * SMP workloads would scale incorrectly in some parallel gridengine environments
 * CycleCloud imposed an artificial 16 disk limit on VMs
 * In some cases, nodes did not get the proper port for the return proxy causing installation failures
 * The `Configuration` text field was not available when editing nodes
 * Default credentials were not selected when starting new clusters
 * Nodes started for `InitialCount` were immediately removed if there was no capacity or quota for them
 * PBSPro was starting up nodes for jobs that were waiting on other jobs
 * Setting `Azure.SingleScaleset=true` on a node now defaults to creating an overprovisioned, single-placement-group scaleset
 * Disabling then re-enabling Let's Encrypt did not properly request a new certificate
