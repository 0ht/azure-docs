# CycleCloud version 7.9.7

## New Features:
 * SSL certificates in PFX format can now be imported
 * Azure logs have been slimmed down so they cover a longer time period.
 * Removed Singularity project

## Resolved Issues:
 * CycleCloud reported redundant "N nodes started" messages
 * The `uid` for a user would sometimes start at 0 instead of 20000.
 * Spot VMs that were evicted while booting would not be handled.
 * Replaced "low-priority VM" wording with "spot VM"
 * The pricing for spot VMs only included the storage costs
 * Userdata password complexity was insufficient for Windows
 * Values that contained quote characters in the cluster definition were not escaped correctly
 * Certain errors showed up as "Failed to process scaleset: null"
 * Terminating the cluster with an image ID that does not exist would give "resource group does not exist" errors
 * In some cases, nodes would stay in `Acquiring` indefinitely
 * Scalesets being deleted outside CycleCloud was not handled properly
 * Overprovisioned scalesets are handled more efficiently
 * In some cases, a scaleset could get stuck in a waiting state
 * Initialization calls no longer go to a file named "azure-None.log"
 * Windows nodes would sometimes incorrectly turn red while booting
 * Changing a nodearray and resubmitting an MPI job could sometimes take an extended amount of time to provision nodes
 * The Add Nodes dialog box did not reflect regional quotas
 * The CLI installer now errors if Python 2.7 is not installed
 * Mitigated CVE issues 2020-14060, 2020-14061, and 2020-14062
