# CycleCloud version 7.5.2

Azure CycleCloud patch release v7.5.2 provides new controls for scalesets and availability sets. It also fixes a number of small issues.

## New Features:

* Network Security Group allows all protocols for public endpoint if protocol not explicitly set.
* Nodearrays support a new `Azure.SingleScaleset` attribute to force all nodes to be launched in one single-placement-group scaleset
* Nodes support new attributes `AvailabilitySet.PlatformFaultDomainCount` and  `AvailabilitySet.PlatformUpdateDomainCount` for availability set placement
* Reduced disk usage by lowering the amount of history retained for certain types of data.

## Resolved Issues:

* Initial user creation password validation errors were not properly displayed
* Fixed "no implicit conversion of Symbol into Integer" error when booting certain Enterprise Linux kernels
