# CycleCloud version 7.9.10

## New Features:
 * Admins can rotate the credentials that CycleCloud uses for nodes in a cluster

## Resolved Issues:
 * An elevation-of-privilege vulnerability existed for a user with access to CycleCloud
 * Some files in JETPACK_HOME had incorrect permissions allowing non-group readers
 * Node-based cluster credentials are now generated when the first cluster starts
 * The `cyclecloud_access` service account had more permissions than were necessary
 * CycleCloud had a slow memory leak that would eventually require a restart
 * Improved accessibility in the UI
 * Non-upgraded clusters created in CycleCloud 7.x but running in 8.x would not correctly run cluster-init.
 * A `java.util.UnknownFormatConversionException: Conversion = '2'` error occurred when a user had insufficient quota to create scalesets
 * T4 VM SKUs were not included in the "GPU" machine type picker
