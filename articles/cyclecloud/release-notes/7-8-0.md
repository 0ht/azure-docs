# CycleCloud version 7.8.0

This release provides improved user management, updates Slurm autoscaling, and increases the orchestration and management efficiency.

## New Features:
 * CycleCloud can now manage multiple user accounts on each cluster node. Users are dynamically added/removed on nodes based on cluster permissions
 * User's SSH public keys are now validated when adding them to the user profiles in the UI
 * Automatic node user management may be enabled/disabled via a global setting
 * Cluster nodes can be pinned to a specific availability zone within a region
 * The autoscaling API now supports a simple core-based allocation
 * The autoscaling API supports  starting/terminating nodes by hostname
 * Added a Python API for easy interaction with the CycleCloud REST API
 * Estimated VM costs now include disk pricing as well as compute pricing
 * The `cyclecloud connect` command takes a hostname to connect to
 * The UI and CLI now displays the nodes hostnames
 * New node attributes `NameFormat` and `NameOffset` allow customized array node names
 * Nodes with `StartAutomatically = false` will stay in the 'off' state when they are added.
 * Clusters of up to 5000 nodes are now supported

## Resolved Issues:
 * Some transient authentication errors were showing as failures in the UI
 * Public IP addresses are properly cleared in the UI when `AssociatePublicIpAddress` is set to false on a node
 * Deallocated nodes no longer show as full price
 * Hb, Hc and H16 Promo SKUs now select the CentOS HPC image correctly
 * In some cases, the cluster would show "Cell execute-XYZ not found" errors
 * SSH proxy failed when connecting through bastion hosts
 * Detection of selinux policy failed on Enterprise Linux version 6
 * In rare cases, form fields would not be saved properly from the UI
 * Fixed an issue with interrupted threads sometimes preventing records from being saved to the datastore
 * Authentication error detail was being omitted from the UI and logs
 * The "Add Nodes" button was not shown properly to non-administrator users
 * Cluster parameter values containing "$" were not being evaluated correctly
