# CycleCloud version 7.9.2


## Resolved Issues:
 * CycleCloud did not handle certain immediate allocation failures that left VMs in a deallocated state
 * Keepalive did not work on PBSPro nodes.
 * Azure API responses which return non-standard JSON beginning with a UTF-8 BOM are now handled without throwing an error
 * Manually installing jetpack on a VM would result in an error.
 * Jetpack pre-installed on custom images would not show as booted even though they were.
 * The `cyclecloud` SSH key would sometimes not be properly deployed on CentOS 6 VMs.
 * The "Awaiting bootup" message re-appeared for  deallocated VMs that were restarted
 * If a VM in a scaleset was deallocated outside CycleCloud, it was not automatically restarted
 * Spurious "The web application [ROOT] created a ThreadLocal" errors appeared on shutdown
 * Node configuration failures would cause "invalid installation status" errors in the event log.
 * LAMMPS clusters would silently fail to fully install.

 ## Deprecated:
 * Removed Blender cluster type.
