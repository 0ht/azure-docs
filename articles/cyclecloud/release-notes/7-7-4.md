# CycleCloud version 7.7.4

This patch release fixes a number of issues that affected selinux, healthcheck and shared gallery images.

## Resolved Issues:
 * The 'force password reset' flag did not work properly
 * SSH bastion CLI arguments did not properly override auto-detected bastion configuration values
 * Transfers between storage accounts would fail.
 * Policy utilities failed to manage selinux in permissive mode.
 * Selecting hundreds of nodes in the lower panel for shutdown would return an error
 * The event log showed "Added 0 nodes" unnecessarily
 * Healthcheck could improperly shutdown a machine causing it to enter a "power stopped" state.
 * Shared gallery images did not work across subscriptions
