# CycleCloud version 7.9.9

## New Features:
 * Added `deallocate_node` command to the CLI
 * Scalesets can now be deleted directly from the UI, if necessary
 * Support installation of LSF 10.1 Fix Pack 11
 * The `PublicIp` for nodes is now available in the REST API
 * Detailed information about REST API calls is now logged (at DEBUG level)

## Resolved Issues:
 * The "Copy Cluster" feature did not handle nodearrays properly on active clusters
 * The CycleCloud CLI would fail on MacOS Catalina with `Abort trap 6`
 * The node's "Stage resources" phase time would sometimes appear much too large.
 * Starting nodes via the CLI could sometimes start nodes in other clusters
 * After restarting CycleServer, some nodes would not report their PrivateIP or Hostname via the CycleCloud REST API.
 * Incorrect version of selinux tools would sometimes be installed on CentOS 8
 * Pre-existing disks referenced with `VolumeId` were deleted on termination
 * Clusters were limited to 20 scalesets of a given type. This has been raised to 200.
 * Improved scaleset throttling behavior when node definitions were changed
