## Azure CycleCloud 7.7 Release Highlights

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [**Revamped autoscale API**](autoscale-api.md)<br/>This release brings a significant change to the CycleCloud autoscaling API, pivoting from a core-centric API to one that is node-oriented. With these change:<br/><br/>  - Clusters can autoscale across different VM families<br/><br/>  - For MPI jobs where node proximity is crucial, schedulers will now be able to implement autoscaling strategies that ensure nodes in an MPI ring are in the same placement group.<br/><br/>  - With the node-oriented API, scheduler implementations can now autoscale by other resource requirements such as memory, GPU or swap space.<br/><br/>This new autoscaling API has been implemented for the default PBSPro and LSF clusters, with the other schedulers to follow in subsequent releases.|![Autoscale sample](./images/release-notes/autoscale-api.png) |

| [**Specify custom images or marketplace images in the Cluster UI**](custom-images.md)<br/>Custom images are now easier to use in CycleCloud. Default cluster templates now allow a user to specify a resource URL for a custom image or marketplace image URN in the template. Gallery images can also be defined in custom templates. |![Custom image sample](./images/release-notes/custom-image.png)  |
| [**Use a Managed Identity in CycleCloud**](managed-identities.md)<br/>Managed Identities is a feature of the Azure Active Directory service for allocating privileges without having to pass secrets or credentials. This release allows a user to configure CycleCloud with the Managed Identity attached to the underlying VM. The privileges assigned to CycleCloud are determined by roles assigned to the Managed Identity. |![Managed identity sample](./images/release-notes/managed-identity-smallfont.gif)  |
