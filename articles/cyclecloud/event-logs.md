# Event Logging

A log of all Azure CycleCloud activity can be found in the Event Log, which is located in the sidebar:

![Event Log](~/images/event_log.png)

You can search the log for a specific event or keyword with the search bar located in the upper right corner. The log can also be changed to show information based on three parameters:

* Event Type
* Priority
* Time Frame

Use the drop down menus to select the event log parameters. The page will automatically refresh to show the appropriate information.
