# Event Logging

A log of all Azure CycleCloud activity can be found in the Event Log, which is located in the user menu:

![Event Log](~/images/event_log.png)

You can search the log for a specific event or keyword with the Search bar located in the upper right corner. The log can also be changed to show information based on three parameters:

* Event Type
* Priority
* Time Frame

Use the drop down menus to select the event log parameters. The page will automatically refresh to show the appropriate information. You can then export the data by clicking the 'save' icon and selecting your preferred format (CSV, JSON, text, or XML). Click **Preview** to view the file, or **Download File** to save.

The "refresh" button will update the event data on the page.
