# pogo Configuration

To use pogo, you need to configure one or more endpoints - remote
locations where objects are stored. To add your first endpoint, type
`pogo config`. This writes a configuration file to
`$HOME/.cycle/pogo.ini`. This file may be viewed or edited with a text
editor of your choice. Multiple urls that use the same credentials can
be specified in the URL(s) field separated by spaces. This corresponds
to the "Matches" line in the pogo.ini file.

Additionally, you may specify default credentials for all instances of a
storage type by leaving the URL(s) field blank. You will then be
prompted for a Section Type. The credentials you enter will then be used
for any endpoint of that storage type where an explicit configuration
doesn't exist.

## pogo.ini

The `pogo.ini` file consists of one or more sections that define an
endpoint. Sections begin with `[pogo <name>]`, and end at the beginning
of a new section OR at the end of the file. Define one setting per line,
and separate the value with an equals sign.

All sections require either `type` and `matches` to be specified. If a
`type` is specified with no `matches`, those settings will be the
default for all endpoints of that type where another explicit
configuration doesn't exist. If a `matches` setting is specified with
out a `type`, pogo will infer the type from the URL.

The common settings listed below apply to all types of endpoints.

## Common Settings

| Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| type        | The endpoint type. Accepted values: `az` (Azure), `fs` (file system), `gs`, `rh` (remote host), or `s3`.                                                                                                                 |
| matches     | A list of one or more comma-separated URLs for the section. URLs for a given section should all share a common protocol, e.g. az//bucket-a, az://bucket-b, az://bucket-c/with_prefix/                                                      |

You can also add encryption keys to the pogo.ini. To specify a default
key, add the key name and encryption mode as per the sample below:

``` pogo-ini
[[encryptionkeys]]
ExampleKey = 7468697369736173616d706c656b6579

[[pogo ExampleSection]]
type = az
encryption_mode = pogo
encryption_keyname = ExampleKey
```

Keys are in string hex format, and by default the system creates 128-bit
keys. To use 192 or 256 bit keys, you will need the Java Cryptography
Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files (or
whatever is analogous for your JVM). Creating 192 or 256-bit keys is not
yet supported - if you wish to use either, you will need to generate
your own key(s).

## File System Settings (fs)

Attributes that apply to file system endpoints only can be added as a
`[pogo default-fs]` section such as:

``` pogo-ini
[pogo default-fs]
  type = fs
  follow_links = true
```

If `follow_links` attribute = true, listing or copying from a file
system will include or transverse into symbolic links.

## `[pogo]`

Your `pogo.ini` file can begin with a `[pogo]` section that contains
attributes to be cascaded down through the other sections. The `[pogo]`
section cannot contain `type` or `matches`, but can use the following
settings (which can also be used in specific endpoint sections):

| Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| retries     | The number of times each internal operation (read/write/query) is retried prior to giving up. For example, a multipart file transfer with a retry setting of 3 will try the read operation of each part 3 times prior to failing the file. |
