# Manual Installation

Azure CycleCloud can [be installed](quickstart-install-cyclecloud.md) using an ARM template, but for production instances of CycleCloud, we recommend installing the product manually as outlined below.

> [!NOTE]
> The CycleCloud product encompasses many pieces, including a command line transfer tool called [pogo](pogo-overview.md), node configuration software known as [Jetpack](jetpack.md), and a installable webserver platform called CycleServer. Because of this, you will find CycleServer referenced in many commands and directory names on the machine where the CycleCloud server is installed.

## System Requirements

To install CycleCloud, you must have administrator rights. In addition, your system needs to meet the following minimum requirements:

* A 64-bit Linux distribution
* Java Runtime Environment (version 8 or higher)
* At least 8GB of RAM
* Four or more CPU cores
* At least 50GB of free disk space
* Administrator (root) privileges
* Active Microsoft Azure Subscription

> [!NOTE]
> CycleCloud may be installed on physical or virtualized hardware.

## SSH Key

You will need to generate your own SSH key for use in CycleCloud. This
key is used by the cycle\_server user, and must be accessible to that
account.

> [!WARNING]
> Use a phraseless SSH key. If you enter a passphrase when generating your SSH key, the return proxy feature of CycleCloud will not work, which may cause node reporting and autoscaling to fail.

## Installation

To begin the installation, unpack the CycleCloud installation to a temporary working directory.

From the local directory, run `install.sh` to begin the installation process. The default install location is /opt/cycle_server.

The install.sh script supports several options for customization:

Option | Definition
------ | ----------
`--batch`| Install without any prompts
`--installdir` | Install to a directory other than /opt/cycle_server
`--force`      | Install to the specified directory even if it is not empty
`--nostart`    | Do not start the processes after the installation is complete

> [!NOTE]
>You must have write permission to the /opt directory. The CycleCloud installer will create a cycle_server user and unix group, install into the /opt/cycle_server directory by default, and assign cycle_server:cycle_server ownership to the directory.

Once the installer has finished running, you will be provided a link to complete the installation
from your browser. Copy the link provided into your web browser. Further configuration is discussed in the Configuration section.

### Notes on Security

The default installation of CycleCloud uses non-encrypted HTTP running on port 8080. We strongly recommend configuring SSL for all installations.

Do not install CycleCloud on a shared drive, or any drive in which non-admin users have access. Anyone with access to the CycleCloud group will gain access to unencrypted data. We recommend that non-admin users not be added to this group.

## Upgrading CycleCloud

To upgrade an existing CycleCloud installation, save the install bundle to the serverâ€™s local drive. The upgrade script will unpack the bundle and install the new package. The upgrade script is `$CS_HOME/util/upgrade.sh` and takes the path to the install bundle as an argument. For example:

``` script
/opt/cycle_server/util/upgrade.sh /tmp/cyclecloud-6.6.0.tar.gz
```

To upgrade the CycleCloud command line tool, copy the new binary over the old. In most cases, upgrades within a release series (e.g. 5.x) do not typically require CLI upgrades.

> [!NOTE]
>As of version 6.6.0, Java Runtime Environment is no longer packaged in the installation. JRE version 8 or higher is required.

## Installing Multiple Instances of CycleCloud on the Same Machine

Running multiple instances of CycleCloud on the same machine is supported, but requires some slight
modifications to the configuration files before starting CycleCloud for the first time.
During the install step, make sure to use the `--nostart` flag to keep the server from starting,
and the `--installdir` flag to specify an alternate install directory. For example:

``` script
/install.sh --nostart --installdir /mnt/second_cycle_server
```

After the installer finishes, edit `$CS_HOME/config/cycle_server.properties` and change the
following port numbers to an unused port (incrementing each default port number by one usually works well):

``` properties
commandPort=6400
webServerPort=8080
webServerSslPort=8443
tomcat.shutdownPort=8007
brokerPort=5672
brokerJmxPort=9099
url=jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/cycle_server
```

Next, edit `$CS_HOME/data/derby.properties` and modify `derby.drda.portNumber`
so that it matches the port specified in the `url=` line of cycle_server.properties.

Finally, copy /etc/init.d/cycle_server to a new file and edit the CS_HOME path
to point to the new CycleServer install, then start CycleServer using the new init script.

## Configuration

After CycleCloud is installed, it is configured through your web browser. The login screen will load after the webserver has fully initialized, which can take several minutes.

## Initial Setup

Step 1: Welcome

![Welcome Screen](~/images/setup-step1.png)

Enter a Site Name, your CycleComputing Account ID, and Password, then click **Next**.

Step 2: License Agreement

![License Agreement](~/images/setup-step2.png)

Accept the license agreement and click **Next**.

Step 3: Administrator Account

![Administrator Account setup](~/images/setup-step3.png)

At this step in the process, you will set up the local administrator account for CycleCloud. This
account is used to administer the CycleCloud application - it is NOT an operating system account.
Enter a user ID and password, then click **Done** to continue.

> [!NOTE]
> All CycleCloud account passwords must be between 8 and 123 characters long, and meet at least 3 of the following 4 conditions:

* Contain at least one upper case letter
* Contain at least one lower case letter
* Contain at least one number
* Contain at least one special character: @ # $ % ^ & * - _ ! + = [ ] { } | \ : ' , . ?
