# Azure CycleCloud

> [!NOTE]
> The CycleCloud product encompasses many pieces, including a command line transfer tool called [pogo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cyclecloud/pogo-overview), node configuration software known as [Jetpack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cyclecloud/jetpack), and a installable webserver platform called CycleServer. Because of this, you will find CycleServer referenced in many commands and directory names on the machine where the CycleCloud server is installed.
