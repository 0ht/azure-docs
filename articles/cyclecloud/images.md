# Images

Azure CycleCloud ships with support for standard operating systems. You can specify the image with `Image`:

    [[node defaults]]
    Image = Cycle Windows 2016

You can also specify by `ImageName`:

    [[node defaults]]
    ImageName = cycle.image.win2016

Finally, you can always select a specific image by `ImageId` or `ImageUrl`:

    [[node defaults]]
    ImageId = order66

    [[node defaults]]
    ImageUrl = http://cloud-provider/path/to/custom-image

CycleCloud automatically uses the latest released version of the image for the cloud provider and region that the instance is in.

> [!NOTE]
If you are using a custom (non-standard) image that was created with Jetpack, you can set `AwaitInstallation=true` on the node, specifying that the image supports sending status messages back to CycleCloud. This will allow for more accurate representations of the node's state within CycleCloud.

CycleCloud currently includes the following images:

| Operating System | Image              | Name                  | Service    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------- |
