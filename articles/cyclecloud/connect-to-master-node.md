# Master Node

To run jobs on your cluster, you must log onto the cluster's **Master** node, where the job queue resides. The SSH public key provided during setup is stored in the Azure CycleCloud application server and pushed into each cluster that you create, which allows you to use your SSH private key to log into the master node. To get the public IP address of the cluster head node, select the master node in the cluster management pane and click the **Connect** button:

The pop-up window shows the connection string you would use to connect to the cluster:

Copy the appropriate string and use your SSH client or Cloud Shell to connect to the master node. After the connection is complete, you will be logged into the master node.

## Submit a Job

Check the status of the job queue with the following commands:

```azurecli-interactive
$ qstat
$ qstat -f
```
The output will list all running or queued jobs and any provisioned execute nodes:

``` output
[name@ip-0A000404 ~]$ qstat -Q

[name@ip-0A000404 ~]$
```

Run any appropriate scripts to submit your job, then run the `qstat` command again to confirm the jobs were submitted.
