# Common Issues: Marketplace Images

## Possible Error Messages

- `Creating Virtual Machine (User failed validation to purchase resources)`

## Resolution

When using a marketplace image with CycleCloud, the service principal must have appropriate permissions on the subscription to programmatically accept the licensing terms for the image. To resolve this issue, you may either grant the appropriate AAD permission to the service principal or use the Azure portal or CLI to accept the terms with a user with appropriate permissions.

To grant access using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli-interactive
$> az vm image accept-terms --urn PUBLISHER:OFFER:SKU:VERSION
```

or

```azurecli-interactive
$> az vm image accept-terms --publisher PUBLISHER --offer OFFER --plan SKU
```
