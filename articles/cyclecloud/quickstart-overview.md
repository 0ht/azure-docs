# QuickStart Overview

Azure CycleCloud is a free application that provides a simple, secure, and scalable way to manage compute and storage resources for HPC and Big Compute/Data workloads. CycleCloud enables users to create environments for workloads on any point of the parallel and distributed processing spectrum, from parallel workloads to tightly-coupled applications such as MPI jobs on Infiniband/RDMA. By managing resource provisioning, configuration, and monitoring, CycleCloud allows users and IT staff to focus on business needs instead infrastructure.

There are four parts to the Azure CycleCloud QuickStart:

*	setup and install CycleCloud on a VM
*	configure and create a simple HPC cluster consisting of a job scheduler and an NFS file server, and submit jobs to observe the cluster autoscale up and down automatically
*	review CycleCloud's cost reporting & controls, reporting, and other features
* clean up resources

## Prerequisites

The Azure CycleCloud quickstart has a few prerequisites:

1.	An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with an active subscription
2.	The [Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/overview?view=azure-cli-latest) installed and configured with an Azure subscription
3.	A [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) in your Azure Active Directory
4.	An SSH keypair

Working through all the quickstarts should take 60 to 90 minutes. You will get the most out of them if they are done in order. Get started now!
