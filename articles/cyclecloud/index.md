# Introduction

Welcome to CycleCloud! To properly introduce our software, we've
created this guide to walk you through the setup and execution of an
auto-scaling batch cluster in Microsoft Azure. After completing the
steps in this guide, you will have a fully functional HTCondor cluster
that can automatically scale according to the demands of your
application. In this demonstration, we will use the HTCondor cluster to
calculate a Newtonian approximation of Pi.
