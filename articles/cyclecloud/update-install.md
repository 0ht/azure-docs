# Update Azure CycleCloud

It is recommended that you keep your Azure CycleCloud installation up to date with the latest version of the software. Please see the [Azure CycleCloud Service Policy](service-policy.md) for the full details on supported versions of the software.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure CycleCloud must be updated as `root` user.

For CentOS, use:

```azurecli-interactive
yum install
```

For Debian and Ubuntu, use:

```azurecli-installation
apt-get install
```

The update will take several minutes. When the update has completed, the server will come back up automatically.
