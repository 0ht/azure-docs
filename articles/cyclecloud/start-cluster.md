# Start a Cluster

Azure CycleCloud has predefined cluster types built into the software. Users can select parameters via the GUI to start a predefined cluster, or create their own in a text file and import it into Azure CycleCloud using the CLI.

When the cluster is started, CycleCloud runs through the orchestration sequence for each node defined in the cluster: it requests an instance from the cloud provider, waits for the instance to be
acquired, configures the instance as defined in the cluster template, and executes
the initialization sequence specified in the cluster-init package. When the orchestration
sequence is complete, the node is in the `Started` state. If an unhandled or unknown error happens during this process, the node will be in the `Error` state.

There are several intermediate states a node can be in while being started, so the progress is
summarized as one of the following Status groups:

- *Off* (gray): No instance is active or being acquired.
- *Acquiring* (yellow): The instance is being requested from the cloud provider.
- *Preparing* (blue): The instance is being configured.
- *Ready* (green): The instance is up and running.
- *Deallocated* (dark gray): The instance has been stopped and the VM has been deallocated.
- *Failed* (red): An orchestration phase has failed during starting or terminating the node.

Azure will not start billing you for an instance while it is being acquired.
If an instance that meets your requirements is not available, you may wait indefinitely for
one to be provisioned. Billing for resources typically begins when the instance
enters the “Preparing” phase, while CycleCloud is installing your software and configuring the
instance to run your workloads.

If a node encounters an error during orchestration and has failed, the error will be logged in
the event log on the Clusters page. You can retry the operation, or edit your node settings.

Clusters imported with the command line tool are immediately available as resources in CycleCloud.
The CycleCloud command line tool also supports importing clusters as templates that may be used to
create additional clusters through the web interface.

You may log on to a node that is in the “Preparing” or “Ready” phase. CycleCloud provides two convenient methods to connect to instances: the “Connect” button on the Nodes tab in the web interface, and via the command line tool. From the web user interface, the “Connect” button displays instructions on initiating ssh or RDP connections. The command line command `cyclecloud connect <nodename>` initiates an ssh connection on Linux, or an RDP session on Windows.

Finally, terminating the cluster will stop and remove the instances and delete any non­-persistent
volumes in the cluster. Nodes that originate from a nodearray are removed, while other nodes
remain in the cluster in the Off state. Terminating is also an orchestration process, with a
status of Terminating, then Off. If there is an error during the process, that node will be marked
as Failed, and can be retried.
