# Azure CycleCloud Tutorial 2: Submit and Auto Scale Jobs

If you've completed Tutorial 1, you've installed, set up, and configured Azure CycleCloud, and started a simple HPC cluster via the GUI. This tutorial will walk you through logging into the cluster, submitting a job, and observing the autoscaling behavior.

::: moniker range="=cyclecloud-7"

## Master Node

To run jobs on the PBS Pro cluster, you must log onto the cluster's **Master** node, where the PBS Pro job queue resides. The SSH public key you provided earlier is stored in the Azure CycleCloud application server and pushed into each cluster that you create. This allows you to use your SSH private key to log into the master node. To get the public IP address of the cluster head node, select the master node in the cluster management pane and click the **Connect** button:

The pop-up window shows the connection string you would use to connect to the cluster:

:::image type="content" source="../images_7x/connect-to-master-node.png" alt-text="CycleCloud Master Node Connection Screen":::

Copy the appropriate string and use your SSH client or Cloud Shell to connect to the master node. After the connection is complete, you will be logged into the master node.

## Scheduler Node

To run jobs on the PBS Pro cluster, you must log onto the cluster's **Server** node, where the PBS Pro job queue resides. The SSH public key you provided earlier is stored in the Azure CycleCloud application server and pushed into each cluster that you create. This allows you to use your SSH private key to log into the master node. To get the public IP address of the cluster head node, select the server node in the cluster management pane and click the **Connect** button:

:::image type="content" source="../images_8x/cluster-connect-button.png" alt-text="CycleCloud Master Node Connect Button":::

The pop-up window shows the connection string you would use to connect to the cluster:

:::image type="content" source="../images_8x/connect-to-scheduler-node.png" alt-text="CycleCloud Master Node Connection Screen":::

Copy the appropriate string and use your SSH client or Cloud Shell to connect to the server node. After the connection is complete, you will be logged into the server node.

## Submit a Job

Check the status of the job queue with the `qstat -Q` command and the provisioned execute nodes with `pbsnodes -Sa`. The output should confirm that no jobs are running and no execute nodes are provisioned:

``` output
[name@ip-00000000 ~]$ qstat -Q
Queue              Max   Tot Ena Str   Que   Run   Hld   Wat   Trn   Ext Type
---------------- ----- ----- --- --- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----
workq                0     0 yes yes     0     0     0     0     0     0 Exec
[name@ip-00000000 ~]$ pbsnodes -Sa
pbsnodes: Server has no node list
```

You can submit a demo job by running `qsub runpi.sh` which submits a job that calculates the value of pi. 

``` output
[name@ip-00000000 ~]$ qsub runpi.sh
1.ip-00000000
```

Verify that the job is now in the queue with `qstat -Q` and that execute nodes are provisioned with `pbsnodes -Sa`:

``` output
[name@ip-00000000 ~]$ qsub runpi.sh
1.ip-00000000
[name@ip-00000000 ~]$ qstat -Q
Queue              Max   Tot Ena Str   Que   Run   Hld   Wat   Trn   Ext Type
---------------- ----- ----- --- --- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----
workq                0     1 yes yes     1     0     0     0     0     0 Exec
[name@ip-00000000 ~]$ pbsnodes -Sa

ip-0000000A     job-busy        --       --       ip-0000000a     --              4gb       2       0       0 --
ip-0000000B     job-busy        --       --       ip-0000000b     --              4gb       2       0       0 --
```

## Auto Scale

Until this point, no execute nodes have been provisioned because the cluster is configured to auto scale. The cluster will detect that the job queue has work in it, and will provision the required compute nodes to execute the jobs. CycleCloud will not provision more cores than the limit set on the cluster's autoscaling settings. In this case, the sample job contains 1000 tasks, but CycleCloud will only provision up to 100 cores worth of virtual machines.

Return to the web interface to see the execute nodes being provisioned. After provisioning, the status bars will turn green and the job's tasks will start running. For non-tightly coupled jobs, where the individual tasks can independently execute, jobs will start running as soon as any VM is ready. For tightly coupled jobs (i.e. MPI jobs), jobs will not start executing until every VM associated with the jobs is ready.

Verify that the job is complete by running `qstat -Q` in your shell periodically. The Queued column (Que) should be 0, indicating that no more jobs are awaiting execution. In this tutorial, jobs typically finish in a minute or two.

Once the job queue has been empty for five minutes, the execute nodes will begin to auto-stop and your cluster will return to just having the PBS head node.

Tutorial 2 is complete. In this exercise, you've submitted a job containing 1000 tasks to the PBS scheduler, confirmed the request went through, and observed the auto scaling via the GUI. When the jobs are complete, you will need to clean up the resources used to free them for other activity.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to continue to use this Azure CycleCloud installation for additional CycleCloud Tutorials you do not need to follow Tutorial 3. Be aware that you are charged for usage while the nodes are running, even if no jobs are scheduled.
