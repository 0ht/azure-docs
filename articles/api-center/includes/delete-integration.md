## Delete an integration

While an API source is integrated, you can't delete synchronized APIs from your API center. If you need to, you can delete the integration. When you delete an integration:

* The synchronized APIs in your API center inventory are deleted
* The environment and deployments associated with the API source are deleted

To delete an integration:

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API center.
1. Under **Assets**, select **Environments** > **Integration (preview)**.
1. Select the integration, and then select **Delete** (trash can icon).
