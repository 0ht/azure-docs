# Configure Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for virtual machines in Azure

The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is a measurement representing the largest size ethernet frame (packet) transmitted by a network device or interface. If a packet exceeds the largest size accepted by the device, the packet is fragmented into multiple smaller packets, then later reassembled at the destination. 

Fragmentation and reassembly can introduce performance and ordering issues, resulting in a suboptimal experience. Optimizing MTU for your solution can provide network bandwidth performance benefits by reducing the total number of packets required to send a dataset.  

The MTU is a configurable setting in a virtual machine's operating system. The default value MTU setting in Azure is 1500 bytes. 

VMs in Azure can support larger MTU than the 1,500-byte default only for traffic that stays within the virtual network.

The following table shows the largest MTU size supported on the Azure Network Interfaces available in Azure:

| Operating System | Network Interface | Largest MTU for inter virtual network traffic |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Windows Server | Mellanox Cx3, Cx4, Cx5 | 3900 </br> **When setting the MTU value with `Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty`, use the value `4088`. The value used when setting the MTU with `netsh` is 3900.** |
| Windows Server | (Preview) Microsoft Azure Network Adapter MANA | 9000 </br> **When setting the MTU value with `Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty`, use the value `9014`. The value used when setting the MTU with `netsh` is 9000.** | 
| Linux | Mellanox Cx3, Cx4, Cx5 | 3900 |
| Linux | (Preview) Microsoft Azure Network Adapter | 9000 |

## Precautions

- Virtual machines in Azure can support a larger MTU than the 1,500-byte default only for traffic that stays within the virtual network. A larger MTU isn't supported for scenarios outside of inter-virtual network VM-to-VM traffic. Traffic traversing through gateways, peeringâ€™s, or to the internet aren't supported. Configuration of a larger MTU can result in fragmentation and reduction in performance. For traffic utilizing these scenarios, utilize the default 1,500 byte MTU for testing to ensure that a larger MTU is supported across the entire network path. 

- Optimal MTU is operating system, network, and application specific. The maximal supported MTU might not be optimal for your use case.

- Always test MTU settings changes in a noncritical environment first before applying broadly or to critical environments.

## Path MTU Discovery

- It's important to understand the MTU supported across the network path your application or machines uses.

- Path MTU discovery is a means to find out the largest MTU supported between a source and destination address.

- Using a larger MTU than is supported between the source and destination address results in fragmentation, which could negatively affect performance.  

## Obtain vm-1 IP address

1. Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **Virtual machines** and select **Virtual machines** from the search results.

1. Select **vm-2**.

1. In the **Overview** of **vm-2**, in the **Networking** section, record the private IP address of **vm-2**. The IP address of **vm-2** is required to test the network path. For the purposes of this article, the example IP address is **10.0.0.4**. Replace the IP address with your own value.

## Obtain vm-2 IP address

1. In the search box, enter **Virtual machines** and select **Virtual machines** from the search results.

1. Select **vm-2**.

1. In the **Overview** of **vm-2**, in the **Networking** section, record the private IP address of **vm-2**. The IP address of **vm-2** is required to test the network path. For the purposes of this article, the example IP address is **10.0.0.5**. Replace the IP address with your own value.

## Test the MTU size on a virtual machine

A shell script for Linux and the PowerShell command `Test-Connection` is used to test the largest MTU size that can be used for a specific network path.

Use the following steps to determine the largest MTU size that can be used for a specific network path:

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

The shell script is available in the Azure samples gallery. Download the script for Linux from the following link and save to **vm-1** and **vm-2**.

- [Linux](link here)

Use the following steps to change the MTU size on a Linux virtual machine:

1. Sign-in to **vm-1**

1. Use the `ip` command to show the current network interfaces and their MTU settings:

    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-linux:~$ ip link show
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:0d:3a:00:bd:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    3: enP1328s1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq eth0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:0d:3a:00:bd:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname enP1328p0s2
    ```

1. Set the MTU value on **vm-1** to the highest value supported by the network interface. 

    * For the Mellanox adapter, use the following example to set the MTU value to **3900**:

    ```bash
    echo '3900' | sudo tee /sys/class/net/eth0/mtu || echo "failed: $?"
    ```

    * For the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter, use the following example to set the MTU value to **9000**:

    ```bash
    echo '9000' | sudo tee /sys/class/net/eth0/mtu || echo "failed: $?"
    ```

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > The MTU changes made in the previous steps don't persist during a reboot. To make the changes permanent, consult the appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution.

1. Sign-in to **vm-2**.

1. Use the `ip` command to show the current network interfaces and their MTU settings:

    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-linux:~$ ip link show
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:0d:3a:00:bd:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    3: enP1328s1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq eth0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:0d:3a:00:bd:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname enP1328p0s2
    ```

1. Set the MTU value on **vm-2** to the highest value supported by the network interface. 

    * For the Mellanox adapter, use the following example to set the MTU value to **3900**:

    ```bash
    echo '3900' | sudo tee /sys/class/net/eth0/mtu || echo "failed: $?"
    ```

    * For the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter, use the following example to set the MTU value to **9000**:

    ```bash

    ```bash
    ./GetPathMtu.sh 10.0.0.5
    ```

1. If the output of the script is successful, then the MTU size is set correctly. If the output of the script isn't successful, then the MTU size isn't set correctly.

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-1:~/GetPathMTU$ ./GetPathMtu.sh 10.0.0.5
    destination: 10.0.0.5
    startSendBufferSize: 1200

    3900
    ```


# [Windows](#tab/windows)

Use PowerShell to test the connection and MTU size between **vm-1** and **vm-2**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You must have the newest version of PowerShell installed in the Windows Server virtual machines. The commands in the article don't work with PowerShell included with Windows Server. For more information about [Installing PowerShell on Windows](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)

Use the following steps to change the MTU size on a Windows Server virtual machine:

1. Sign-in to **vm-1**.

1. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator.

1. Use the following example to display the current network interfaces.

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapter
    ```

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\azureuser> Get-NetAdapter

    Name                      InterfaceDescription                    ifIndex Status       MacAddress             LinkSpeed
    ----                      --------------------                    ------- ------       ----------             ---------
    Ethernet 2                Mellanox ConnectX-5 Virtual Adapter          10 Up           60-45-BD-CC-77-01       100 Gbps
    Ethernet                  Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter             6 Up           60-45-BD-CC-77-01       100 Gbps
    ```

    The virtual machine has two network interfaces displayed in the output.

1. Record the value of the MAC address of the network interface. You'll need this value for the next step. For the purposes of this article, the example value is **60-45-BD-CC-77-01**. Replace the value with your own value.

1. Windows Virtual machine support both the Mellanox interface and the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter. 
    
    * To set the value on the Mellanox interface, use the following example to set the MTU value to **4088**. Replace the value of the MAC address with your own value.

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapter | ? {$_.MacAddress -eq "60-45-BD-CC-77-01"} | Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -RegistryKeyword "*JumboPacket" -RegistryValue 4088
    ```

    * To set the value on the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter, use the following example to set the MTU value to **9014**. Replace the value of the MAC address with your own value.

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapter | ? {$_.MacAddress -eq "60-45-BD-CC-77-01"} | Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -RegistryKeyword "*JumboPacket" -RegistryValue 9014
    ```

1. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic is required between the source and destination to test the MTU size. Use the following example to enable ICMP traffic on **vm-1**:
