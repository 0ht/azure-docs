> [!NOTE]
> Use Azure Deployment Environments (ADE) instead of Azure DevTest Labs to ensure consistency and compliance with your organization's policies. ADE offers built-in scalability and enhanced security features. ADE environments make resource management easier, reducing manual setup time and errors, so developers can focus on innovation. They also support teamwork across development, testing, and operations teams. With more flexibility and customization options, ADE provides a more efficient and personalized experience, speeding up development and boosting productivity.
