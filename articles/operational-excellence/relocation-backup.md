# Relocate Azure Recovery Vault (ARV) to another region

This article covers relocation guidance for [Azure Recovery Vault](../backup/backup-overview.md) across regions.

Redeploy of Recovery Service vault and reconfigure the backup for resources to another region Recovery Service vault using below mechanism:

The Azure Recovery Vault platform includes the following services:

- [Backup Services](../backup/backup-overview.md)
- [Site Recovery Services](../site-recovery/site-recovery-overview.md)

While Azure Backup doesnâ€™t support the movement of backup data from one Recovery Services vault to another across regions, you can redeploy ecovery Service vault and reconfigure the backup for resources to another region.


If you want to move an Azure Recovery Service Vault that doesn't have any client specific data/backup and the instance itself can be moved alone, simply redeploy the Storage Account using [IAC - Microsoft.RecoveryServices vaults](/azure/templates/microsoft.recoveryservices/vaults?tabs=json&pivots=deployment-language-arm-template).

Otherwise, continue to follow the guidelines in this article.

## Prerequisites

- Copy the following list of internal resources or settings of ARV.
    - Network firewall reconfiguration
    - Alert Notification.
    - Move workbook if configured
    - Diagnostic settings reconfiguration
- List all Recovery Service Vault dependent resources.
- Whether the VM is moved with the vault or not, you can always restore the VM from the retained backup history in the vault.
- Copy the backup VM configuration metadata to validate once the relocation complete.
- Confirm that all services and features that are in use by source RSV are supported in the target region.

3. Select **Export template**. 
4. Choose **Download** in the **Export template** page.
5. Locate the .zip file that you downloaded from the portal, and unzip that file to a folder of your choice.

   This zip file contains the .json files that include the template and scripts to deploy the template.


6. Validate all the associated resources detail in the downloaded template like Private endpoint, Backup policy, security setting like soft delete etc.

7. Update the parameter of the Recovery Vault and change the value property under parameters like Recovery Vault name, replication type, sku, target location etc.

8. Once the target Recovery service vault created, then reconfigure all the associated settings that were copied from source Recovery service vault:
    - (Optiona) Private Endpoint - Please follow the procedure to relocate a [virtual network]](/technical-delivery-playbook/azure-services/networking/virtual-network/) as described and create the Private Endpoint.
    - Network firewall reconfiguration
