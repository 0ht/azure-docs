The Azure Recovery Vault platform includes the following services:

- [Backup Services](../backup/backup-overview.md)
- [Site Recovery Services](../site-recovery/site-recovery-overview.md)

While Azure Backup doesnâ€™t support the movement of backup data from one Recovery Services vault to another across regions, you can redeploy ecovery Service vault and reconfigure the backup for resources to another region.


If you want to move an Azure Recovery Service Vault that doesn't have any client specific data/backup and the instance itself can be moved alone, simply redeploy the Storage Account using [IAC - Microsoft.RecoveryServices vaults](/azure/templates/microsoft.recoveryservices/vaults?tabs=json&pivots=deployment-language-arm-template).
