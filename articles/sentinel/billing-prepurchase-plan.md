# Optimize Microsoft Sentinel costs with a prepurchase plan

Save on your Microsoft Sentinel costs when you prepurchase Microsoft Sentinel commit units (CUs). Use the prepurchased CUs at any time during the one year purchase term. Any eligible Microsoft Sentinel costs deduct first from the prepurchased CUs automatically. You don't need to redeploy or assign a prepurchased plan to your Microsoft Sentinel workspaces for the CU usage to get the prepurchase discounts.

## Determine the right size to buy

Prepurchase plans pair nicely with Microsoft Sentinel commitment tiers. Once you plan your Microsoft Sentinel ingestion volume and reduce complexity with a simplified pricing tier, choose an appropriate commitment tier. Then it's easier to decide on the right prepurchase plan size to buy.

Think of the prepurchase plan as a pool of credits called commit units (CUs) where CUs are equivalent to your purchase currency value.
