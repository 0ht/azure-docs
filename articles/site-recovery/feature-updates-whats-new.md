# Site Recovery updates

## Updates (November 2023)

### Use Azure Business Continuity center (preview)

You can now also manage Azure Site Recovery protections using Azure Business Continuity (ABC) center. ABC enables you to manage your protection estate across solutions and environments. It provides a unified experience with consistent views, seamless navigation, and supporting information to provide a holistic view of your business continuity estate for better discoverability with the ability to do core activities.
