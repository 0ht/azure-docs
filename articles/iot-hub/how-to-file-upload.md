# Upload files from your device to the cloud with Azure IoT Hub

This article demonstrates how to:

* Use [file upload capabilities of IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-file-upload.md) to upload a file to [Azure blob storage](../storage/index.yml), using an Azure IoT device and service SDKs.
* Notify IoT Hub that the file was successfully uploaded and create a backend service to receive file upload notifications from IoT Hub.

The [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub](../iot/tutorial-send-telemetry-iot-hub.md?toc=/azure/iot-hub/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-hub/breadcrumb/toc.json&pivots=programming-language-csharp) quickstart and [Send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub](c2d-messaging-dotnet.md) article show the basic device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging functionality of IoT Hub. The [Configure Message Routing with IoT Hub](tutorial-routing.md) article shows a way to reliably store device-to-cloud messages in Microsoft Azure blob storage. However, in some scenarios, you can't easily map the data your devices send into the relatively small device-to-cloud messages that IoT Hub accepts. For example:

* Videos
* Large files that contain images
* Vibration data sampled at high frequency
* Some form of preprocessed data

These files are typically batch processed in the cloud, using tools such as [Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/introduction.md) or the [Hadoop](../hdinsight/index.yml) stack. When you need to upload files from a device, you can still use the security and reliability of IoT Hub. This article shows you how.

## Prerequisites

* An IoT hub. Create one with the [CLI](iot-hub-create-using-cli.md) or the [Azure portal](iot-hub-create-through-portal.md). Some SDK calls require the IoT Hub connection string.

* A registered device. Register one in the [Azure portal](iot-hub-create-through-portal.md).

* IoT Hub **Service Connect**  permission - To receive file upload notification messages, your backend service needs the **Service Connect** permission. By default, every IoT Hub is created with a shared access policy named **service** that grants this permission. For more information, see [Create an IoT hub using the Azure portal](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal).

* An Azure Storage account and Azure Blob Storage container associated with IoT Hub. You can configure this using the [Azure portal](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-configure-file-upload), [Azure CLI](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-configure-file-upload-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-configure-file-upload-powershell).
