# Monitor Azure IoT Hub

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

## Monitor per-device disconnects with Event Grid

Azure Monitor provides a metric, *Connected devices*, that you can use to monitor the number of devices connected to your IoT Hub. This metric triggers an alert when the number of connected devices drops below a threshold value. Azure Monitor also emits events in the [connections category](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#connections-category) that you can use to monitor device connects, disconnects, and connection errors. While these events might be sufficient for some scenarios, [Azure Event Grid](../event-grid/index.yml) provides a low-latency, per-device monitoring solution that you can use to track device connections for critical devices and infrastructure.

With Event Grid, you can subscribe to the IoT Hub [**DeviceConnected** and **DeviceDisconnected** events](iot-hub-event-grid.md#event-types) to trigger alerts and monitor device connection state. Event Grid provides a much lower event latency than Azure Monitor, so you can monitor on a per-device basis rather than for all connected devices. These factors make Event Grid the preferred method for monitoring connections for critical devices and infrastructure. We highly recommend using Event Grid to monitor device connections in production environments.

For more information about monitoring device connectivity with Event Grid and Azure Monitor, see [Monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot device connectivity to Azure IoT Hub](iot-hub-troubleshoot-connectivity.md).

### Collection and routing

Platform metrics, the Activity log, and resource logs have unique collection, storage, and routing specifications.

In the Azure portal from your IoT hub under **Monitoring**, you can select **Diagnostic settings** followed by **Add diagnostic setting** to create diagnostic settings scoped to the logs and platform metrics emitted by your IoT hub.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-iot-hub/add-diagnostic-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add a diagnostic setting in your IoT hub in the Azure portal." border="true":::

The following screenshot shows a diagnostic setting for routing the resource log type *Connection Operations* and all platform metrics to a Log Analytics workspace.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-iot-hub/diagnostic-setting-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Diagnostic Settings form for monitoring an IoT hub." lightbox="media/monitor-iot-hub/diagnostic-setting-portal.png":::

For more information on creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure IoT Hub are listed  under [Resource logs in the Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#resource-logs). Events are emitted only for errors in some categories.

When routing IoT Hub platform metrics to other locations:

- These platform metrics aren't exportable by using diagnostic settings: *Connected devices* and *Total devices*.

- Multi-dimensional metrics, for example some [routing metrics](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routing-metrics), are currently exported as flattened single dimensional metrics aggregated across dimension values. For more information, see [Exporting platform metrics to other locations](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#exporting-platform-metrics-to-other-locations).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]

### Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each IoT hub includes charts that provide some usage metrics, such as the number of messages used and the number of devices connected to the IoT hub.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-iot-hub/overview-portal.png" alt-text="Default metric charts on IoT hub Overview page.":::

A correct message count value might be delayed by 1 minute. Due to the IoT Hub service infrastructure, the value can sometimes bounce between higher and lower values on refresh. This counter should be incorrect only for values accrued over the last minute.

The information presented on the **Overview pane** is useful, but represents only a small amount of monitoring data that's available for an IoT hub. Some monitoring data is collected automatically and available for analysis as soon as you create your IoT hub. You can enable other types of data collection with some configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The events emitted by the IoT Hub service using Azure Monitor resource logs aren't guaranteed to be reliable or ordered. Some events might be lost or delivered out of order. Resource logs aren't intended to be real-time, so it may take several minutes for events to be logged to your choice of destination.

### Metrics explorer

You can analyze metrics for Azure IoT Hub with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer. For more information on this tool, see [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics.md).

To open metrics explorer, go to the Azure portal and open your IoT hub, then select **Metrics** under **Monitoring**. This explorer is scoped, by default, to the platform metrics emitted by your IoT hub.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-iot-hub/metrics-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the metrics explorer page for an IoT hub." lightbox="media/monitor-iot-hub/metrics-portal.png":::

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure IoT Hub, see [Metrics in the Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#metrics). For a list of the platform metrics collected for all Azure services, see [Supported metrics with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

For IoT Hub platform metrics that are collected in units of count, some aggregations might not be available or usable. To learn more, see [Supported aggregations in the Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#supported-aggregations).

Some IoT Hub metrics, like [routing metrics](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routing-metrics), are multi-dimensional. For these metrics, you can apply [filters](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts.md#filters) and [splitting](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts.md#apply-splitting) to your charts based on a dimension.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

### Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties. The data in these tables are associated with a Log Analytics workspace and can be queried in Log Analytics. To learn more about Azure Monitor Logs, see [Azure Monitor Logs overview](../azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs.md) in the Azure Monitor documentation. 

To route data to Azure Monitor Logs, you must create a diagnostic setting to send resource logs or platform metrics to a Log Analytics workspace. To learn more, see [Collection and routing](#collection-and-routing).

To perform Log Analytics, go to the Azure portal and open your IoT hub, then select **Logs** under **Monitoring**. These Log Analytics queries are scoped, by default, to the logs and metrics collected in Azure Monitor Logs for your IoT hub.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-iot-hub/logs-portal.png" alt-text="Logs page for an IoT hub." lightbox="media/monitor-iot-hub/logs-portal.png":::

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Azure Monitor Logs tables in the Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md#top-level-common-schema). You can find the schema and categories of resource logs collected for Azure IoT Hub in [Resource logs in the Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#resource-logs). Events are emitted only for errors in some categories.

The [Activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

When routing IoT Hub platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs:

- The following platform metrics aren't exportable by using diagnostic settings: *Connected devices* and *Total devices*.

- Multi-dimensional metrics, for example some [routing metrics](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#routing-metrics), are currently exported as flattened single dimensional metrics aggregated across dimension values. For more detail, see [Exporting platform metrics to other locations](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#exporting-platform-metrics-to-other-locations).

For common queries with IoT Hub, see [Sample Kusto queries](#sample-kusto-queries). For more information on using Log Analytics queries, see [Overview of log queries in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md).

### SDK version in IoT Hub logs

Some operations in IoT Hub resource logs return an `sdkVersion` property in their `properties` object. For these operations, when a device or backend app is using one of the Azure IoT SDKs, this property contains information about the SDK being used, the SDK version, and the platform on which the SDK is running. 

The following examples show the `sdkVersion` property emitted for a [`deviceConnect`](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#connections-category) operation using:

- The Node.js device SDK: `"azure-iot-device/1.17.1 (node v10.16.0; Windows_NT 10.0.18363; x64)"`
- The .NET (C#) SDK: `".NET/1.21.2 (.NET Framework 4.8.4200.0; Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763 WindowsProduct:0x00000004; X86)"`.

The following table shows the SDK name used for different Azure IoT SDKs:

| SDK name in sdkVersion property | Language |
|----------|----------|
| .NET | .NET (C#) |
| microsoft.azure.devices | .NET (C#) service SDK |
| microsoft.azure.devices.client | .NET (C#) device SDK |
| iothubclient | C or Python v1 (deprecated) device SDK |
| iothubserviceclient | C or Python v1 (deprecated) service SDK |
| azure-iot-device-iothub-py | Python device SDK |
| azure-iot-device | Node.js device SDK |
| azure-iothub | Node.js service SDK |
| com.microsoft.azure.iothub-java-client | Java device SDK |
| com.microsoft.azure.iothub.service.sdk | Java service SDK |
| com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.iot-device-client | Java device SDK |
| com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.iot-service-client | Java service SDK |
| C | Embedded C |
| C + (OSSimplified = Eclipse ThreadX) | Eclipse ThreadX |

You can extract the SDK version property when you perform queries against IoT Hub resource logs. For example, the following query extracts the SDK version property (and device ID) from the properties returned by Connections operations. These two properties are written to the results along with the time of the operation and the resource ID of the IoT hub that the device is connecting to.

```kusto
// SDK version of devices
// List of devices and their SDK versions that connect to IoT Hub
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.DEVICES" and ResourceType == "IOTHUBS"
| where Category == "Connections"
| extend parsed_json = parse_json(properties_s) 
| extend SDKVersion = tostring(parsed_json.sdkVersion) , DeviceId = tostring(parsed_json.deviceId)
| distinct DeviceId, SDKVersion, TimeGenerated, _ResourceId
```

### Read logs from Azure Event Hubs

After you set up event logging through diagnostics settings, you can create applications that read out the logs so that you can take action based on the information in them. The following sample code retrieves logs from an event hub.

```csharp
class Program
{ 
    static string connectionString = "{your AMS eventhub endpoint connection string}";
    static string monitoringEndpointName = "{your AMS event hub endpoint name}";
    static EventHubClient eventHubClient;
    //This is the Diagnostic Settings schema
    class AzureMonitorDiagnosticLog
    {
        string time { get; set; }
        string resourceId { get; set; }
        string operationName { get; set; }
        string category { get; set; }
        string level { get; set; }
        string resultType { get; set; }
        string resultDescription { get; set; }
        string durationMs { get; set; }
        string callerIpAddress { get; set; }
        string correlationId { get; set; }
        string identity { get; set; }
        string location { get; set; }
        Dictionary<string, string> properties { get; set; }
    };

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Monitoring. Press Enter key to exit.\n");
        eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, monitoringEndpointName);
        var d2cPartitions = eventHubClient.GetRuntimeInformationAsync().PartitionIds;
        CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        foreach (string partition in d2cPartitions)
        {
            tasks.Add(ReceiveMessagesFromDeviceAsync(partition, cts.Token));
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine("Exiting...");
        cts.Cancel();
        Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());
    }

    private static async Task ReceiveMessagesFromDeviceAsync(string partition, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var eventHubReceiver = eventHubClient.GetDefaultConsumerGroup().CreateReceiver(partition, DateTime.UtcNow);
        while (true)
        {
            if (ct.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                await eventHubReceiver.CloseAsync();
                break;
            }
            EventData eventData = await eventHubReceiver.ReceiveAsync(new TimeSpan(0,0,10));
            if (eventData != null)
            {
                string data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.GetBytes());
                Console.WriteLine("Message received. Partition: {0} Data: '{1}'", partition, data);
                var deserializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();
                //deserialize json data to azure monitor object
                AzureMonitorDiagnosticLog message = new JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize<AzureMonitorDiagnosticLog>(result);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
