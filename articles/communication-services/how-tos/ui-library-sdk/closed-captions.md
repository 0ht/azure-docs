# Closed captions

Closed captions play a critical role in video voice calling apps, providing numerous benefits that enhance the accessibility, usability, and overall user experience of these platforms.

In this article, you learn how to enable closed captions scenarios using the UI Library.

## Azure Communication Service Based Captions

Supported by default for calls involving Azure Communication Service users only. Currently, Azure Communication Service captions **do not** support language translation.

## Teams Interop Closed Captions

Also supported by default and included during calls with **one or more** Teams users.
Translation Support: Unlike Azure Communication Service captions, Teams Interop Closed Captions support translation. Users can opt to have captions translated into a different language through the captions settings.

## Activate Closed Captions

### User Interaction

The Azure Communication Services UI Library offers the capabilities to enable closed captions in the calling composite and set up the default language, but the end users are always capable to select the language via UI interaction.

#### Spoken language

If a different language is being used in the meeting, users can change the spoken language via the UI. This change applies to all users in the call.

#### Caption Language

- There's no default caption language set.
- Change the caption language by clicking on the Captions Language button after captions have started, if translation to a different language is desired.

#### Supported languages

Azure Communication Services supports a variety of spoken languages for captions. Below is the list of supported language codes that can be used with the `setSpokenLanguage` method to set the desired language for captions:
