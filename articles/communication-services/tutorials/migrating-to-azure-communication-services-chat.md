# Migrate from Twilio Conversations Chat to Azure Communication Services

This article describes how to migrate an existing Twilio Conversations implementation to the [Azure Communication Services Chat SDK](../concepts/chat/sdk-features.md). Both Twilio Conversations s and Azure Communication Services Chat SDK are cloud-based platforms that enable developers to add chat features to their web applications.

However, there are some key differences between them that may affect your choice of platform or require some changes to your existing code if you decide to migrate. In Twilio chat is embedded into a conversation which is a multichannel instance. Azure Communication Services Chat SDK is a single channel for chat. In this article, we compare the main features and functions of both platforms and provide some guidance on how to migrate an existing Twilio Conversations chat implementation to Azure Communication Services Chat SDK.

This article doesn't cover creating a service tier to manage tokens for your chat application. See [chat concepts](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md) for more information about chat architecture, and [user access tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md) for more information about access tokens.
