# Pre-Call diagnostics

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

The pre-call API feature allows developers to programmatically validate a clientâ€™s readiness to join an Azure Communication Services call. You can only access pre-call features using the Calling SDK. The pre-call diagnostic feature provides multiple diagnostics including device, connection, and call quality. Provide us with [feedback](../../support.md) about which platforms you want to see pre-call diagnostics enabled.

## Pre-Call diagnostics access

To access pre-call diagnostics, you need to initialize a `CallClient`, and provision an Azure Communication Services access token. Then you can access the `PreCallDiagnostics` feature and the `startTest` method.

```c#
string acsToken = "";
try
{
    var credential = new CallTokenCredential(acsToken);
    var callClient = new CallClient();

    var features = callClient.Features;
    var preCallDiagnosticsFeature = features.PreCallDiagnostics;

    preCallDiagnosticsFeature.DiagnosticsReady += DiagnosticsReady;
    await preCallDiagnosticsFeature.StartTestAsync(credential);
}
catch (Exception ex) { }
```

Once it finishes running, developers can access the result object.

## Diagnostic results

Pre-call diagnostics return a full diagnostic of the device including details like availability and compatibility, call quality statistics, and in-call diagnostics. The results are returned as a `PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEvent` object.

```c#
private void DiagnosticsReady(object sender, PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEventArgs args)
{
    var diagnostics = args.Diagnostics;
    var mediaStatsReport = diagnostics.MediaStatisticsReport;

    var outgoingStatsList = mediaStatsReport.OutgoingStatistics;
    if (outgoingStatsList != null)
    {
        var videoStatsList = outgoingStatsList.Video;
        var ScreenShareStatsList = outgoingStatsList.ScreenShare;
        var audioStatsList = outgoingStatsList.Audio;
    }

    var incomingStatsList = mediaStatsReport.IncomingStatistics;
    if (incomingStatsList != null)
    {
        var videoStatsList = incomingStatsList.Video;
        var ScreenShareStatsList = incomingStatsList.ScreenShare;
        var audioStatsList = incomingStatsList.Audio;
    }
}
```

You can access individual result objects using the `PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEvent` type. Results for individual tests are returned as they are completed with many of the test results being available immediately. The results might take up to 1 minute as the test validates the quality of the video and audio.

### Device permissions

The permission check determines whether video and audio devices are available from a permissions perspective. Provides `boolean` value for `audio` and `video` devices. 

```c#
var permissionList = preCallDiagnosticsFeature.DevicePermissions;
```

## Pricing

When the pre-call diagnostic test runs behind the scenes, it uses calling minutes to run the diagnostic. The test lasts for roughly 30 seconds, using up 30 seconds of calling time which is charged at the standard rate of $0.004 per participant per minute. For the case of pre-call diagnostics, the charge is for 1 participant x 30 seconds = $0.002.
