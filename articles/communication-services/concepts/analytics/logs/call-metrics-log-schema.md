## Sample data for various call types

### P2P call 

Here are shared fields for all logs in a P2P call:

```json
"time":                     "2021-07-19T18:46:50.188Z",
"resourceId":               "SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/RESOURCEGROUPS/ACS-TEST-RG/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.COMMUNICATION/COMMUNICATIONSERVICES/ACS-PROD-CCTS-TESTS",
"correlationId":            "aaaa0000-bb11-2222-33cc-444444dddddd",
```

### Group call

Data for a group call is generated in three call summary logs and six call diagnostic logs. Here are shared fields for all logs in the call:

```json
"time":                     "2021-07-05T06:30:06.402Z",
"resourceId":               "SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/RESOURCEGROUPS/ACS-TEST-RG/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.COMMUNICATION/COMMUNICATIONSERVICES/ACS-PROD-CCTS-TESTS",
"correlationId":            "bbbb1111-cc22-3333-44dd-555555eeeeee",
```

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I store logs?
The following section explains this requirement.

Azure Communication Services logs are not stored in your Azure account by default so you need to begin storing them in order for tools like [Voice and video Insights Dashboard](../insights/voice-and-video-insights.md) and [Call Diagnostics](../../voice-video-calling/call-diagnostics.md) to work. To collect these call logs, you need to enable a diagnostic setting that directs the call data to a Log Analytics workspace. 

**Data isnâ€™t stored retroactively, so you begin capturing call logs only after configuring the diagnostic setting.**

Follow instructions to add diagnostic settings for your resource in [Enable logs via Diagnostic Settings in Azure Monitor](../enable-logging.md). We recommend that you initially **collect all logs**. After you understand the capabilities in Azure Monitor, determine which logs you want to retain and for how long. When you add your diagnostic setting, you're prompted to [select logs](../enable-logging.md#adding-a-diagnostic-setting). To collect **all logs**, select **allLogs**.

Your data volume, retention, and usage in Log Analytics within Azure Monitor is billed through existing Azure data meters. We recommend that you monitor your data usage and retention policies for cost considerations as needed. For more information, see [Controlling costs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#controlling-costs).

If you have multiple Azure Communications Services resource IDs, you must enable these settings for each resource ID.
