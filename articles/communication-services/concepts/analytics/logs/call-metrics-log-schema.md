# Call Metrics Log Schema

This document explains the ACSCallingMetrics logs available to you through Azure Monitor in the form of [Resource Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/data-sources.md#azure-resources). 

Call Metrics logs are used in the **[Voice and video Insights Dashboard](../insights/voice-and-video-insights.md)** to visualize long term graphs of reliability, quality, and performance based on count of succeeded and failed Calling SDK api calls of various operations. Use these logs to gain a clearer understanding of daily aggregated calling metrics across various dimensions for your communication workloads. You can also set up automated alerts when a metric falls. **ankesh please explain how to do alerts**

Call Metrics logs contain aggregated calling metrics in daily bins based on attributes such as SDK Version, OS name, and Error Subcode.

## Data Concepts

> [!IMPORTANT]
>You must collect logs if you want to analyze them. To learn more see: **[How do I store logs?](#how-do-i-store-logs)**
>
>Azure doesn't store your call log data unless you enable these specific Diagnostic Settings. Your call data is not retroactively available. You accumulate data once you set up the Diagnostic Settings.


In the log schema there is a property called `MetricName` that details the various metrics that are sent in this schema. The metrics are broken down into two main caetgoreies API Metrics and UFD metrics. UFD metrics are further broken down into two groups that explain the volume of UFD occurences how well they recovered during a call. categories which are detailed below. 

## Public Facing Metrics Definitions

### API Metrics

- These UFDs are visualized in the Voice idiiddi insights dashboard in the UFD tab. To see how you can leverage these data learn more please seee: link to Inisghts page. To understand how the visuals are generated you can edit the existing workbook and see the queries behind the visuals.

These metrics measure both the successes and failures (dcount) of the calling SDK public APIs (e.g., mute, join, etc.).

- reliability/api/CreateView/Local
- reliability/api/Join
- reliability/api/StartVideo
- reliability/api/AcceptIncomingCall
- reliability/api/CreateView/Remote
- reliability/api/StopVideo
- reliability/api/CallAgentInit
- reliability/api/StartCall

### User Facing Diagnostics (UFD) Metrics

- These UFDs are visualized in the Voice idiiddi insights dashboard in the UFD tab. To see how you can leverage these data learn more please seee: link to Inisghts page. To understand how the visuals are generated you can edit the existing workbook and see the queries behind the visuals.

- To learn more about UFDs please see: [User Facing Diagnostics](../../voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md)

#### User Facing Diagnostics (UFD) leg metrics: (dcount of participants (legs) that had at least one bad UFD during a call)

Provides counts of how many participant were impacted by a UFD in a call.   

- reliability/leg/UFD/NetworkReconnect
- reliability/leg/UFD/CameraStoppedUnexpectedly
- reliability/leg/UFD/MicrophoneMuteUnexpectedly
- reliability/leg/UFD/NetworkReceiveQuality
- reliability/leg/UFD/MicrophonePermissionDenied
- reliability/leg/UFD/MicrophoneNotFunctioning
- reliability/leg/UFD/NoMicrophoneDevicesEnumerated
- reliability/leg/UFD/CameraPermissionDenied
- reliability/leg/UFD/CameraStartFailed
- reliability/leg/UFD/CapturerStoppedUnexpectedly
- reliability/leg/UFD/CapturerStartFailed
- reliability/leg/UFD/CameraStartTimedOut
- reliability/leg/UFD/NoSpeakerDevicesEnumerated
- reliability/leg/UFD/CameraFreeze
- reliability/leg/UFD/NetworkRelaysNotReachable
- reliability/leg/UFD/SpeakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted
- reliability/leg/UFD/NoNetwork
- reliability/leg/UFD/NetworkSendQuality
- reliability/leg/UFD/ScreenshareRecordingDisabled

#### User Facing Diagnostics (UFD) API recovery metrics: (dcount of occurrences that had an issue but subsequently recovered during a call)  

Provides counts of how many UFDs were triggered during a call by the calling SDK, but subsequently recovered during the call. For example, the network reconnect UFD was triggered one time in a call, but the network succesfully recovered during the call. Therefore the count of good UFD is â‰¥ the count of bad UFDs in the call. Then the recovery rate of that UFD would be 100%.

## Sample data for various call types

### Call Metrics log for P2P and group calls

For the call metric log, there's no difference between P2P and group call scenarios. **????????The number of logs depends on the SDK operations and call duration**. The following code is a generic sample showing the schema of these logs.

### Call Metrics Log

Here's are two sample rows of the Call Metrics log:

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I store logs?
The following section explains this requirement.

Azure Communication Services logs are not stored in your Azure account by default so you need to begin storing them in order for tools like [Voice and video Insights Dashboard](../insights/voice-and-video-insights.md) and [Call Diagnostics](../../voice-video-calling/call-diagnostics.md) to work. To collect these call logs, you need to enable a diagnostic setting that directs the call data to a Log Analytics workspace. 

**Data isnâ€™t stored retroactively, so you begin capturing call logs only after configuring the diagnostic setting.**

Follow instructions to add diagnostic settings for your resource in [Enable logs via Diagnostic Settings in Azure Monitor](../enable-logging.md). We recommend that you initially **collect all logs**. After you understand the capabilities in Azure Monitor, determine which logs you want to retain and for how long. When you add your diagnostic setting, you're prompted to [select logs](../enable-logging.md#adding-a-diagnostic-setting). To collect **all logs**, select **allLogs**.

Your data volume, retention, and usage in Log Analytics within Azure Monitor is billed through existing Azure data meters. We recommend that you monitor your data usage and retention policies for cost considerations as needed. For more information, see [Controlling costs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#controlling-costs).

If you have multiple Azure Communications Services resource IDs, you must enable these settings for each resource ID.
