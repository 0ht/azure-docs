# What is Azure Extended Zones?

Azure Extended Zones are small-footprint extensions of Azure placed in metros, industry centers, or a specific jurisdiction to serve low latency and/or data residency workloads. Azure Extended Zones supports VMs, containers, storage, and a selected set of Azure services and can run latency-sensitive and throughput-intensive applications close to end users and within approved data residency boundaries. This eases low latency and/or data regulation needs for users, when applicable in their situation. Azure Extended Zones are part of the Microsoft global network that provides secure, reliable, high-bandwidth connectivity between applications that run at an Azure Extended Zone close to the user.
