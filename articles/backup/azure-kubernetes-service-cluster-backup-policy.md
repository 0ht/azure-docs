# Audit and Enforce Backup Operations for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters using Azure Policy 

One of the key responsibilities of a Backup or Compliance Admin in an organization is to ensure that all business-critical machines are backed up with the appropriate retention.

Today, Azure Backup provides various built-in policies (using [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md)) to help you automatically ensure that your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters are prepped for backup configuration. Depending on how your backup teams and resources are organized, you can use any one of the below policies:

## Policy 1 - Azure Backup Extension should be installed in AKS clusters

It is an [audit-only](../governance/policy/concepts/effects.md#audit) policy. This policy identifies which AKS clusters don't have backup extension installed but doesn't automatically install backup extension for these AKS clusters. It is useful when you're only looking to evaluate the overall preparedness of the AKS clusters for backup compliance but not looking to take action immediately.

## Policy 2 - Azure Backup should be enabled for AKS clusters

It is an [audit-only](../governance/policy/concepts/effects.md#audit) policy. This policy identifies which clusters don't have backup enabled but doesn't automatically configure backups for these clusters. It's useful when you're only looking to evaluate the overall compliance of the clusters but not looking to take action immediately.

## Policy 3 - Install Azure Backup Extension in AKS clusters (Managed Cluster) with a given tag.

A central backup team in an organization can use this policy to install backup extension to any AKS clusters in a region. You can choose to **include** clusters that contain a certain tag, in the scope of this policy.

## Policy 4 - Install Azure Backup Extension in AKS clusters (Managed Cluster) without a given tag.

A central backup team in an organization can use this policy to install backup extension to any AKS clusters in a region. You can choose to **exclude** clusters that contain a certain tag, from the scope of this policy.

## Supported Scenarios

* The built-in policy is currently supported only for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters. 

* Users must take care to ensure that the necessary [prerequisites](azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup-concept.md#Backup Extension) are enabled before Policies 3 and 4 are assigned.

* Policies 3 and 4 can be assigned to a single region and subscription at a time. 

* For Policies 1, 2, 3 and 4, management group scope is currently unsupported.

## Using the built-in policies

The below steps describe the end-to-end process of assigning Policy 3: **Install Azure Backup Extension in AKS clusters (Managed Cluster) with a given tag**. Similar instructions apply for the other policies. Once assigned, any new AKS cluster created under this scope has backup extension installed automatically.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and navigate to the **Policy** Dashboard.
2. Select **Definitions** in the left menu to get a list of all built-in policies across Azure Resources.
3. Filter the list for **Category=Backup** and select the policy named *Install Azure Backup Extension in AKS clusters (Managed Cluster) with a given tag*.

4. Select the name of the policy. You're then redirected to the detailed definition for this policy.

5. Select the **Assign** button at the top of the pane. This redirects you to the **Assign Policy** pane.
6. Under **Basics**, select the three dots next to the **Scope** field. It opens up a right context pane where you can select the subscription for the policy to be applied on. You can also optionally select a resource group, so that the policy is applied only for AKS clusters in a particular resource group.

7. In the **Parameters** tab, choose a location from the drop-down, and select the storage account to which the backup extension installed in the AKS cluster in the scope must be associated. You can also choose to specify a tag name and an array of tag values. An AKS cluster that contains any of the specified values for the given tag are excluded from the scope of the policy assignment.

8. Ensure that **Effect** is set to deployIfNotExists.
9. Navigate to **Review+create** and select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]

> - Azure Policy can also be used on existing AKS clusters, using [remediation](../governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources.md).
