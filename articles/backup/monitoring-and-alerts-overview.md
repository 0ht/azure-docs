# Monitoring and Reporting solutions for Azure Backup

This article provides an overview of different monitoring and reporting solutions provided by Azure Backup.

Azure Backup offers integration with various Azure services, such as Azure Resource Graph, Azure Monitor Alerts, Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics), and Azure Resource Health. Azure Backup also offers interfaces to various Azure clients, such as Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure REST API. Depending on your monitoring and reporting requirements, you can use a combination of these integrations.

## Monitoring and Reporting scenarios

The following sections provide an overview of the different monitoring and reporting scenarios that commonly arise in enterprise backup deployments. Today, Azure Backup provides the capabilities for each scenario, along with the relevant document references.

| Scenario | Outcome | Solutions available |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Track backup related jobs and health** | Identify gaps in the backup estate and make corrections if the expectation isn't met. |  - **Built-in on Azure Business Continuity Center**: You can monitor backup jobs in real time via the [ Azure Business Continuity Center](../business-continuity-center/tutorial-monitor-operate.md) dashboard. <br><br>     - **Activity Logs**: You can use standard [Activity Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) for your vaults to view information on various user-triggered actions, such as modification of backup policies, restoration of a backup item, and so on. <br><br>        - **Customized monitoring dashboards**: Azure Backup allows you to use non-portal clients, such as [PowerShell](backup-azure-vms-automation.md), [CLI](create-manage-azure-services-using-azure-command-line-interface.md), and [REST API](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-managejobs.md), to query backup monitoring data for use in your custom dashboards. You can also query your backups at scale (across vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Lighthouse tenants) using [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](query-backups-using-azure-resource-graph.md). <br><br>        - **Azure Monitor Metrics (preview)**: Azure Backup provides health metrics via [Azure Business Continuity Center](../backup/query-backups-using-azure-resource-graph.md) and [Azure Monitor](query-backups-using-azure-resource-graph.md),  which shows granular details about the health of protected items under a vault. Azure backup provides metrics at vault level to monitor [backup and restore health events](metrics-overview.md). This also allows you to configure alerts and notifications on these metrics. You can also use [Resource health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) to monitor the health of your Recovery Services vault and Backup vaults to troubleshoot service errors causing resource health issues.  |
| **Get alerted to critical backup incidents** | Take quick reactive actions in case of an issue. | - **Built-in alerts using Azure Monitor**: Azure Backup provides an [alerting solution](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md#azure-monitor-alerts-for-azure-backup) based on Azure Monitor for critical scenarios, such as security and failed jobs: deletion of backup data, disabling of soft-delete, backup failures, and restore failures etc. You can view and manage these alerts via [Azure Business Continuity Center](../business-continuity-center/tutorial-monitor-alerts-metrics.md#view-metrics). To [configure notifications](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md#configuring-notifications-for-alerts) for these alerts (emails), you can use [Action rules of Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-action-rules?tabs=portal) and [Action groups](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups) to route alerts to a wide range of notification channels.   <br><br>     - **Custom alerts**: If you've scenarios where an alert needs to be generated based on custom logic, you can use [ARG based](/azure/governance/resource-graph/alerts-query-quickstart?tabs=arg-log-analytics) alerts or [Log Analytics based](backup-azure-monitoring-use-azuremonitor.md#create-alerts-by-using-log-analytics) alerts. ARG based alerts are appropriate for scenarios that need real time alerting however, due to the current [frequency at which data in a Log Analytics workspace](backup-azure-monitoring-use-azuremonitor.md#diagnostic-data-update-frequency) is updated. Log Analytics based alerts must be used for scenarios where it's acceptable to have a short time difference between the occurrence of the actual incident and the generation of the alert. Log Analytics based alerts can be configured provided you've set up your vaults to send diagnostics data to a Log Analytics (LA) workspace.     <br><br>   - **Azure Backup Metric Alerts using Azure Monitor (preview)**: You can write custom alert rules using Azure Monitor metrics to monitor the health of your backup items across different KPIs. Metrics based alerts are recommended when you are looking for a status signal like success or failure of jobs and not details. You can use metric alerts to get alerted on job success. [Learn more](metrics-overview.md).    <br><br>    - **Classic Alerts**: This is the older alerting solution, which you can [access using the Backup Alerts](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md#backup-alerts-in-recovery-services-vault) tab in the Recovery Services vault blade. These alerts don't appear in Business Continuity Center and are being deprecated. If you're using classic alerts, we recommend you [migrate to using one or more of the Azure Monitor based alert](move-to-azure-monitor-alerts.md#migrate-from-classic-alerts-to-built-in-azure-monitor-alerts) solutions (described above) as it's the forward-looking solution for alerting.  |
| **Analyze historical trends** | Provides targeted proof for audit and executive reports seamlessly. | - **Built-in reports**: You can use Backup Reports (based on Azure Monitor Logs) to analyze historical trends related to job success, backup usage and discover optimization opportunities for your backups. You can also configure periodic emails for these reports.  <br><br>   - **Out-of-box reports**: It provides out of box reports on Azure Business Continuity Center that can be consumed for analyzing historical data. These reports also act as sample templates that can be edited to cater to your reporting requirements. You can also query the data in Azure Monitor Logs (LA) using the documented system functions to create your own report (using workbooks) to analyze historical information related to your backups. \
