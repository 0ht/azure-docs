# Troubleshooting Nexus Kubernetes Cluster pods stuck in ContainerCreating status
This guide provides detailed steps for troubleshooting Nexus Kubernetes Cluster pods stuck in `ContainerCreating` status

## Prerequisites

* Command line access to the Nexus Kubernetes Cluster is required
* Necessary permissions to make changes to the Nexus Kubernetes Cluster objects
   
## Symptoms

In environments operating at scale, there are rare instances where pods using the `nexus-volume` storage class Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) may become stuck in the `ContainerCreating` status.

Check if the pod is experiencing the error described below by describing its details and examining the its events.

``` console
kubectl describe pod <pod name>
```
``` console
Events:

```


## Solution
To address this issue, the following workaround can be applied for pods...

**Steps to Resolve:**
1. Identify the StatefulSet whose pods are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` status.
2. Scale down the StatefulSetâ€™s replicas to zero: 

``` console
kubectl scale statefulset <statefulset-name> --replicas=0 
``` 
3. Wait until the persistent volume attachments are gone, the persistent volume name in this example is pvc-561a2f5b-f673-4f6c-aa4d-34dbc4a6224e (persistent volumes are called pvc-xxx in most cases, they are not volume claims despite the pvc prefix) by doing:
```sh
kubectl get volumeattachments | grep -c pvc-561a2f5b-f673-4f6c-aa4d-34dbc4a6224e
0
```
(The expectation is that these should clear up quickly, usually in a matter of a minute or two).

4. Scale up the StatefulSet to the desired number of replicas:
 ```sh
kubectl scale statefulset <statefulset-name> --replicas=<desired-replica-count> 
```
