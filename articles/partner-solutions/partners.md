# Extend Azure with Azure Native ISV Services

Partner organizations use Azure Native ISV Services to offer solutions which are fully integrated with Azure to enhance your cloud infrastructure. Use a resource provider, resource types, and SDKs to manage the solution as you would with other solutions from Microsoft.

Subscribe to any Azure Native ISV Service through [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/).
