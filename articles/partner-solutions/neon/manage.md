1. Navigate to the Overview for your instance of the Neon resource. 

1. Select the SSO URL.

> [!NOTE] 
> The first time you access this URL, depending on your Azure tenant settings, you might be asked to verify your email address on the Neon portal. Once the email address is verified, you can access the Neon portal.

## Delete a Neon resource

Once the Neon resource is deleted, all billing stops for that resource through Azure Marketplace. If you're done using your resource and would like to delete it, follow these steps:

1. From the Resource menu, select the Neon resource you would like to delete.

1. On the working pane of the **Overview**, select **Delete**.

1. Confirm that you want to delete the Neon resource by entering the name of the resource.

1. Choose the reason why would you like to delete the resource.

1. Select **Delete**.
