If you're done using your resource and would like to delete it, follow these steps:

Begin by signing in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. From the **Resource** menu, choose the resource you would like to delete.

1. From the working pane's command bar, select **Overview** > **Delete**.

    The **Delete Resource** pane appears in the sidebar.

1. Type the name of the resource into the **Confirm Delete** field.

1. Choose a reason for deleting the resource.

1. Select **Delete**.

Once the resource is deleted, all billing through Azure Marketplace stops for that resource.
