# Map of NFS 3.0 commands to Azure Blob Storage REST operations for Azure Blob Storage

When you run an NFS 3.0 command that operates on data in your storage account, that command is translated into a REST operation. This article maps NFS 3.0 commands to Azure Blob Storage REST operations.  

## Command mapping

The following table shows the operations that are used by each NFS 3.0 command. To determine the price of each operation, see [Map each REST operation to a price](../blobs/map-rest-apis-transaction-categories.md).

### Commands that target the Blob Service Endpoint

| Command | Scenario | Operations |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| | | |

### Commands that target the Data Lake Storage endpoint

| Command | Scenario | Operations |
