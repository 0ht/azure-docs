# Azure Database for MySQL trigger for Functions

> [!NOTE]
> In consumption plan functions, automatic scaling is not supported for Database for MySQL trigger. If the automatic scaling process stops the function, all processing of events will stop and it will need to be manually restarted.
>
> Use premium or dedicated plans for [scaling benefits](functions-scale.md) with MySQL trigger.

The Azure Database for MySQL trigger creates a new column to monitor when a row is created, or deleted. The Trigger bindings monitor the user table for changes (inserts, updates) and invokes the function with updated row data.

Azure MySQL Trigger bindings use "az_func_updated_at" and column's data, to monitor the user table for changes. As such, it is necessary to alter the table structure to allow change tracking on the MySQL table before using the trigger support. The change tracking can be enabled on a table through following query. For example, enable on ‘Products’ table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The leases table contains all columns corresponding to the primary key from the user table and two additional columns _az_func_AttemptCount and _az_func_LeaseExpirationTime. So, if any of the primary key columns happen to have the same name, that will result in an error message listing any conflicts. In this case, the listed primary key columns must be renamed for the trigger to work.


The Azure Database for MySQL trigger scaling decisions for the Consumption and Premium plans are done via target-based scaling. For more information, see [Target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling.md).

## Functionality Overview

When the trigger function starts, it will initiate two separate loops (Change Polling Loop and Lease Renewal Loop) that will run continuously until the function is stopped.

The Azure Database for MySQL trigger binding uses a polling loop to check for changes, triggering the user function when changes are detected. At a high level, the loop looks like this:

```
while (true) {
    1. Get list of changes on table - up to a maximum number controlled by the MySql_Trigger_MaxBatchSize setting
    2. Trigger function with list of changes
    3. Wait for delay controlled by MySql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs setting
}
```

Changes are processed in the order that they were made, with the oldest changes being processed first. A couple notes about change processing:
1. If changes to multiple rows are made at once the exact order that they are sent to the function is based on order by the “az_func_updated_at” column’s data in increasing order.
2. Changes are "batched" together for a row. If multiple changes are made to a row between each iteration of the loop, then only the latest change entry exists for that row will be considered.

> [!NOTE]
>Trigger Binding with table name containing alphanuemric & _(underscore) are supported. Apart from that Trigger Binding doesn't support any other special characters like (-, * $).

<!-->Changes are processed in the order that their changes were made, with the oldest changes being processed first. A couple notes about change processing:

1. If changes to multiple rows are made at once the exact order that they are sent to the function is based on the order returned by the CHANGETABLE function
2. Changes are "batched" together for a row. If multiple changes are made to a row between each iteration of the loop then only a single change entry exists for that row which will show the difference between the last processed state and the current state
3. If changes are made to a set of rows, and then another set of changes are made to half of those same rows, then the half of the rows that weren't changed a second time are processed first. This processing logic is due to the above note with the changes being batched - the trigger will only see the "last" change made and use that for the order it processes them in

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

More samples for the Azure Database for MySQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/samples).


The example refers to a `Product` class and a corresponding database table:

<!-- >:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-sql-todo-sample/ToDoModel.cs" range="6-16"::: -->
```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.MySql.Samples.Common
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int? ProductId { get; set; }

        public string Name { get; set; }

        public int Cost { get; set; }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            if (obj is Product)
            {
                var that = obj as Product;
                return this.ProductId == that.ProductId && this.Name == that.Name && this.Cost == that.Cost;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
```


<!-- >:::code language="sql" source="~/functions-sql-todo-sample/sql/create.sql" range="1-7"::: -->
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;

CREATE TABLE Products (
	ProductId int PRIMARY KEY,
	Name varchar(100) NULL,
	Cost int NULL
);
```


Change tracking is enabled on the database by adding one column to the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE <table name>  
ADD COLUMN az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP 
DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The MySQL trigger binds to a `IReadOnlyList<MySqlChange<T>>`, a list of `MySqlChange` objects each with two properties:
- **Item:** the item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema as seen in the `ToDoItem` class.
- **Operation:** a value from `MySqlChangeOperation` enum. The possible values is `Update` for both insert and update.

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) that is invoked when there are changes to the `Product` table:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.MySql.Samples.Common;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.MySql.Samples.TriggerBindingSamples
{
    public static class ProductsTrigger
    {
        [FunctionName(nameof(ProductsTrigger))]
        public static void Run(
            [MySqlTrigger("Products", "MySqlConnectionString")]
            IReadOnlyList<MySqlChange<Product>> changes,
            ILogger logger)
        {
            // The output is used to inspect the trigger binding parameter in test methods.
            logger.LogInformation("MySQL Changes: " + JsonConvert.SerializeObject(changes));
        }
    }
}
```

## Example usage
<a id="example"></a>

More samples for the Azure Database for MySQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/samples/samples-java).


The example refers to a `Product` class, a `MySqlChangeProduct` class, a `MySqlChangeOperation` enum, and a corresponding database table:

In a separate file `Product.java`:

```java
package com.function.Common;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;

public class Product {
    @JsonProperty("ProductId")
    private int ProductId;
    @JsonProperty("Name")
    private String Name;
    @JsonProperty("Cost")
    private int Cost;

    public Product() {
    }

    public Product(int productId, String name, int cost) {
        ProductId = productId;
        Name = name;
        Cost = cost;
    }
}
```

In a separate file `MySqlChangeProduct.java`:
```java
package com.function.Common;

public class MySqlChangeProduct {
    private MySqlChangeOperation Operation;
    private Product Item;

    public MySqlChangeProduct() {
    }

    public MySqlChangeProduct(MySqlChangeOperation operation, Product item) {
        this.Operation = operation;
        this.Item = item;
    }
}
```

In a separate file `MySqlChangeOperation.java`:
```java
package com.function.Common;

import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName;

public enum MySqlChangeOperation {
    @SerializedName("0")
    Update
}
```

<!--> :::code language="sql" source="~/functions-sql-todo-sample/sql/create.sql" range="1-7"::: -->
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;

CREATE TABLE Products (
	ProductId int PRIMARY KEY,
	Name varchar(100) NULL,
	Cost int NULL
);
```


Change tracking is enabled on the database by adding the below column to the table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE <table name>  
ADD COLUMN az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP 
DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

The MySQL trigger binds to a `MySqlChangeProduct[]`, an array of `MySqlChangeProduct` objects each with two properties:
- **item:** the item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema as seen in the `Product` class.
- **operation:** a value from `MySqlChangeOperation` enum. The possible values is `Update` for both insert and update.


The following example shows a Java function that is invoked when there are changes to the `Product` table:

## Optional Configuration

The following optional settings can be configured for the MySQL trigger for local development or for cloud deployments.

### host.json

[!INCLUDE [app settings to local.settings.json](../../includes/functions-host-json-section-intro.md)]

| Setting | Default| Description|
|---------|---------|---------|
|**MaxBatchSize** | 100 |The maximum number of changes processed with each iteration of the trigger loop before being sent to the triggered function.|
|**PollingIntervalMs** | 1000 | The delay in milliseconds between processing each batch of changes. (1000 ms is 1 second)|
|**MaxChangesPerWorker**| 1000 | The upper limit on the number of pending changes in the user table that are allowed per application-worker. If the count of changes exceeds this limit, it might result in a scale-out. The setting only applies for Azure Function Apps with [runtime driven scaling enabled](#enable-runtime-driven-scaling).|

#### Example host.json file

Here is an example host.json file with the optional settings:

```JSON
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensions": {
      "MySql": {
        "MaxBatchSize": 300,
        "PollingIntervalMs": 1000,
        "MaxChangesPerWorker": 100
      }
  },
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "excludedTypes": "Request"
      }
    },
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
```

### local.setting.json

The local.settings.json file stores app settings and settings used by local development tools. Settings in the local.settings.json file are used only when you're running your project locally. When you publish your project to Azure, be sure to also add any required settings to the app settings for the function app.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Because the local.settings.json may contain secrets, such as connection strings, you should never store it in a remote repository. Tools that support Functions provide ways to synchronize settings in the local.settings.json file with the [app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) in the function app to which your project is deployed.

| Setting | Default| Description|
|---------|---------|---------|
|**MySql_Trigger_BatchSize** | 100 |The maximum number of changes processed with each iteration of the trigger loop before being sent to the triggered function.|
|**MySql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs** | 1000 | The delay in milliseconds between processing each batch of changes. (1000 ms is 1 second)|
|**MySql_Trigger_MaxChangesPerWorker**| 1000 | The upper limit on the number of pending changes in the user table that are allowed per application-worker. If the count of changes exceeds this limit, it might result in a scale-out. The setting only applies for Azure Function Apps with [runtime driven scaling enabled](#enable-runtime-driven-scaling).|

#### Example local.settings.json file

Here is an example local.settings.json file with the optional settings:

```JSON
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
    "MySqlConnectionString": "",

## Set up change tracking (required)

Setting up change tracking for use with the Azure Database for MySQL trigger requires to add a column in table using a function.  These steps can be completed from any MySQL tool that supports running queries, including [Visual Studio Code](/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/mssql-extensions) or [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio).

Azure Database for MySQL Trigger ndings use "az_func_updated_at" and column's data, to monitor the user table for changes. As such, it is necessary to alter the table structure to allow change tracking on the MySQL table before using the trigger support.

The change tracking can be enabled on a table through following query. For example, enable on ‘Products’ table:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Products;
    ADD az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    ```
The leases table contains all columns corresponding to the primary key from the user table and two additional columns _az_func_AttemptCount and _az_func_LeaseExpirationTime. So, if any of the primary key columns happen to have the same name, that will result in an error message listing any conflicts. In this case, the listed primary key columns must be renamed for the trigger to work.

<!-- >The `CHANGE_RETENTION` option specifies the time period for which change tracking information (change history) is kept.  The retention of change history by the MySQL database might affect trigger functionality. For example, if the Azure Function is turned off for several days and then resumed, the database will contain the changes that occurred in past two days in the above setup example.

    The `AUTO_CLEANUP` option is used to enable or disable the clean-up task that removes old change tracking information. If a temporary problem that prevents the trigger from running, turning off auto cleanup can be useful to pause the removal of information older than the retention period until the problem is resolved.

     More information on change tracking options is available in the [SQL documentation](/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-tracking-sql-server). 

2. Enable change tracking on the table, substituting `your table name` with the name of the table to be monitored (changing the schema if appropriate):

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[your table name]
    ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING;
    ```

    The trigger needs to have read access on the table being monitored for changes and to the change tracking system tables. Each function trigger has an associated change tracking table and leases table in a schema `az_func`. These tables are created by the trigger if they don't yet exist.

## Enable runtime-driven scaling

Optionally, your functions can scale automatically based on the number of changes that are pending to be processed in the user table. To allow your functions to scale properly on the Premium plan when using MySQL triggers, you need to enable runtime scale monitoring.

## Retry support

<!-- >Further information on the MySQL trigger [retry support](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/main/docs/BindingsOverview.md#retry-support-for-trigger-bindings) and [leases tables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/main/docs/TriggerBinding.md#internal-state-tables) is available in the GitHub repository. -->

### Startup retries
If an exception occurs during startup then the host runtime automatically attempts to restart the trigger listener with an exponential backoff strategy. These retries continue until either the listener is successfully started or the startup is canceled.

<!-- >### Broken connection retries
If the function successfully starts but then an error causes the connection to break (such as the server going offline) then the function continues to try and reopen the connection until the function is either stopped or the connection succeeds. If the connection is successfully re-established then it picks up processing changes where it left off.

Note that these retries are outside the built-in idle connection retry logic that MySqlClient has which can be configured with the `ConnectRetryCount` and `ConnectRetryInterval` [connection string options](/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-5.0&preserve-view=true#Microsoft_Data_SqlClient_SqlConnection_ConnectionString). The built-in idle connection retries are attempted first and if those fail to reconnect then the trigger binding attempts to re-establish the connection itself. -->

### Function exception retries
If an exception occurs in the user function when processing changes then the batch of rows currently being processed are retried again in 60 seconds. Other changes are processed as normal during this time, but the rows in the batch that caused the exception are ignored until the timeout period has elapsed.

If the function execution fails five times in a row for a given row then that row is completely ignored for all future changes. Because the rows in a batch are not deterministic, rows in a failed batch might end up in different batches in subsequent invocations. This means that not all rows in the failed batch will necessarily be ignored. If other rows in the batch were the ones causing the exception, the "good" rows might end up in a different batch that doesn't fail in future invocations.
