# Firmware analysis for device builders

Just like computers have operating systems, IoT devices have firmware, and it's the firmware that runs and controls IoT devices. For IoT device builders, security is a near-universal concern as IoT devices have traditionally lacked basic security measures.

For example, IoT attack vectors typically use easily exploitable--but easily correctable--weaknesses such as hardcoded user accounts, outdated and vulnerable open-source packages, or a manufacturer's private cryptographic signing key. 

Use firmware analysis to identify embedded security threats, vulnerabilities, and common weaknesses that may be otherwise undetectable.

For more information on firmware analysis for device builders, see the [firmware analysis documentation](/azure/firmware-analysis/overview-firmware-analysis).
