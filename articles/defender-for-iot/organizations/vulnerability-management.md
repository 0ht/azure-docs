# Overview of vulnerability management in the Azure portal

With vulnerability management, Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Azure portal provides extended coverage for OT networks, gathers OT device data into one place, and displays the data with the other devices on your network.<!-- I dont agree with this sentence. Is it focusing on VM or D4IoT? THe VM: With vulnerability management, Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Azure portal proivides extended security coverage of OT networks, by identifying security weakness in the network(Better way to write this without using the word vulnerability?) gathering the data to be analyzed and displays individualized device data. -->
Meir - can I rewrite this intro as follows:
With vulnerability management, Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Azure portal proivides extended security coverage of OT networks, by identifying security weakness in the network(Better way to write this without using the word vulnerability?) gathering the data to be analyzed and displays individualized device data.

The OT security administrator proactively manages network exposure based on the vulnerability details and recommended remediation actions. The vulnerability data is displayed in the device inventory, workbooks and in the security recommendations for each device.

## Vulnerabilities in the Device inventory

The Device inventory displays the current vulnerabiltiies detected on each device. For more information, see [device inventory](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md#view-full-device-details).

Defender for IoT provides vulnerability coverage for [supported OT vendors](resources-manage-proprietary-protocols.md) where Defender for IoT can detect firmware models and firmware versions. Vulnerability data is based on the repository of standards-based vulnerability data documented in the US government National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and is displayed with its CVE details and description.

## Vulnerability management workbook

Data about the vulnerabilities detected on OT devices is available using the **Vulnerabilities** workbook. Workbooks are pages created by Microsoft and provided out-of-the-box, which contain graphs and charts to display your data and help you analyze the data more effectively. For more information, see [view workbooks](workbooks.md#view-workbooks).

## Vulnerability based security recommendations

OT devices listed in the Device inventory will suggest security recommendations for any critically severe vulnerability detected on it. The vulnerability recommendation is called **Secure your vulnerable <vendor> devices**.

The recommendations are based on the device vendor or CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency) and will list the remediation steps needed to improve the security of the network. For more information, see [supported security recommendations](recommendations.md#supported-security-recommendations).
