# Overview of vulnerability management in the Azure portal

With vulnerability management, Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Defender portal provides extended coverage for OT networks, gathers OT device data into one place, and displays the data with the other devices on your network.

The OT security administrator proactively manages network exposure based on the vulnerability details and recommended remediation actions.

## Vulnerabilities in the device inventory

The device inventory displays the current vulnerabiltiies specific to each device. For more information, see [device inventory](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md#view-full-device-details).

Displays current vulnerabilities specific to the device. Defender for IoT provides vulnerability coverage for [supported OT vendors](resources-manage-proprietary-protocols.md) where Defender for IoT can detect firmware models and firmware versions.<br><br>Vulnerability data is based on the repository of standards-based vulnerability data documented in the US government National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Select the CVE name to see the CVE details and description. <br><br>**Tip**: View vulnerability data across your network with the [Defender for IoT Vulnerability workbook](workbooks.md#view-workbooks).

## Vulnerability management workbook

Data about the vulnerabilities detected on OT devices is available using the **Vulnerabilities** workbook. For more information, see [view workbooks](workbooks.md#view-workbooks).

## Vulnerability based security recommendations

OT devices listed in the Device inventory will suggest security recommendations for any critically severe vulnerability detected on it. The vulnerability recommendation is called **Secure your vulnerable <vendor> devices**. The recommendations are based on the device vendor or CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency) and will list the remediation steps needed to secury the network. For more information, see [supported security recommendations](recommendations.md#supported-security-recommendations).
