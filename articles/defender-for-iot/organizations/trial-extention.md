## Frequently asked questions

### How do I purchase a Defender for IoT license on Microsoft Admin Center?

To purchase a full Defender for IoT license at the end of the trial period, see [purchase a Defender for IoT license](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md#purchase-a-defender-for-iot-license).

### Customer have more than 5,000 devices on site. What is the license to use?

In the Azure portal, 2XL and 3XL site tiers are available to select from. The customer should contact their repesentative to find out how to access this option.

### Is it possible to purchase more than 1 license for a single site? For example, a customer has 2000 devices and wants to purchase 2 Large license instead of 1 X Large license

No, this is not possible. Customers should purchase the license tier that covers the number of devices they have at the site. So for a site with more than 1000 devices customers need to purchase an XL license. The only exception is the XL license, which can have multiple licenses applied to one site if there are more than 5000 OT devices there.

### How do I migrate a license from the old ACR license to the new M365 license? ACR - Azure Commercial R

To migrate from the legacy Azure Commercial R<!-- what is this?--> (ACR) license to the new Microsoft 365 license, see [migrate from a legacy OT plan](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md#migrate-from-a-legacy-ot-plan).

### What is the duration of a M365 license?

The Microsoft 365 license lasts for one year.

### Is it possible to cancel a paid license?

Customers can cancel a paid license within seven days of the start of the license and recieve a prorated refund. After seven days, they should [turn off recurring billing](../microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/renew-your-subscription) to prevent automatic renewal.​

A customer can also deactivate license. For more information, see [cancel your subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription).​

A customer can cancel the license from **Plans and pricing**. To learn more, see [cancel a Defender for IoT plan for OT networks](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md#cancel-a-defender-for-iot-plan-for-ot-networks).​

### What will happen upon license expiration and what is the data retention policy?

Tenants without an active site license have a 30-day grace period from the last expired license to renew the expired licenses. Afterward the 30 days the Defender for IoT service stops, and data retention stops after 90 days.​

### Are there specific hardware components a customer is required to deploy?

Yes. Microsoft has partnered with Arrow Electronics to provide pre-configured appliances. To purchase a pre-configured appliance, contact Arrow at: hardware.sales@arrow.com. For more details, see [OT pre-configured appliances help guide](ot-pre-configured-appliances.md) or [the OT monitoring appliance catalog](appliance-catalog/).

### What is a site? - where is this, can link to the answer

I couldnt find the answer for this?

### Does Defender or IoT enforce the maximum number of devices for a site for the trial license? What happens if a customer exceeds the number of devices covered by their license? Will monitoring and security coverage be stopped for additional devices?

No, the customer will continue to receive the full security benefits of Defender for IoT during the trial license period even if there are more than 1000 devices. At the end of the trial license period, the customer needs to purchase a new license that is updated to the appropriate size for their network.​
