# Microsoft Security Copilot in Defender EASM

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM) continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure. This visibility enables security and IT teams to identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall. Attack Surface Insights are generated by analyzing vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase the key areas of concern for your organization.

Defender EASM’s integration with Microsoft Security Copilot enables users to interact with Microsoft’s discovered attack surfaces. These attack surfaces allow users to quickly understand their externally facing infrastructure and relevant, critical risks to their organization. They provide insight into specific areas of risk, including vulnerabilities, compliance, and security hygiene. For more information about Microsoft Security Copilot, go to [What is Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot).  For more information on the embedded Microsoft Security Copilot experience, refer to [Query your attack surface with Defender EASM using Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/query-attack-surface).

## Know before you begin

If you're new to Microsoft Security Copilot, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with it by reading these articles:

## Microsoft Security Copilot integration in Defender EASM

Microsoft Security Copilot can surface insights from Defender EASM about an organization's attack surface. You can use the system features built into Microsoft Security Copilot, and use prompts to get more information. This information can help you understand your security posture and mitigate vulnerabilities.

This article introduces you to Microsoft Security Copilot and includes sample prompts that can help Defender EASM users.

## Key features

The EASM Security Copilot integration can help you:

- Get a snapshot of your external attack surface and generate insights into potential risks.

  You can get a quick view of your external attack surface by analyzing internet-available information combined with the Defender EASM proprietary discovery algorithm. It provides an easy-to-understand natural language explanation of the organization's externally facing assets, such as hosts, domains, webpages, and IP addresses. It highlights the critical risks associated with each.

- Prioritize remediation efforts based on asset risk and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list items.

  Defender EASM helps security teams prioritize their remediation efforts by helping them understand which assets and CVEs pose the greatest risk in their environment. It analyzes vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase key areas of concern, providing a natural language explanation of the risks and recommended actions.

- Use Security Copilot to surface insights.

  You can use Security Copilot to ask about insights by using natural language and extract insights from Defender EASM about your organization's attack surface. Query details like the number of SSL certificates that are not secure, ports detected, and specific vulnerabilities that affect the attack surface.

- Expedite attack surface curation.

  Use Security Copilot to curate your attack surface by using labels, external IDs, and state modifications for a set of assets. This process speeds up curation, so you can organize your inventory faster and more efficiently.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use your Defender EASM skills even if you haven't purchased Defender EASM. For more information, see [Plugin capabilities reference](#plugin-capabilities-reference).

## Sample Defender EASM prompts

Microsoft Security Copilot primarily uses natural language prompts. When you querying information from Defender EASM, you submit a prompt that guides Microsoft Security Copilot to select the Defender EASM plugin and invoke the relevant capability.

For success with Copilot prompts, we recommend the following:

- Ensure that you reference the company name in your first prompt. Unless otherwise specified, all future prompts will provide data about the initially specified company.

- Be clear and specific with your prompts. You might get better results if you include specific asset names or metadata values (for example, CVE IDs) in your prompts.

  It might also help to add **Defender EASM** to your prompt, like:

  - **According to Defender EASM, what are my expired domains?**
  - **Tell me about Defender EASM high-priority attack surface insights.**

- Experiment with different prompts and variations to see what works best for your use case. Chat AI models vary, so iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you receive.

- Microsoft Security Copilot saves your prompt sessions. To see previous sessions, in Microsoft Security Copilot, on the menu, select **My sessions**.

### Switch between resource data and company data

Even though we added resource integration for our skills, we still support pulling data from prebuilt attack surfaces for specific companies. To improve the Security Copilot accuracy in determining when a customer wants to pull from their attack surface or from a prebuilt, company attack surface, we recommend using **my**, **my attack surface**, and so on, to convey that you want to use your resource. Use **their**, ***specific company name***, and so on to convey that you want to use a prebuilt attack surface. Although this does improve the experience in a single session, we strongly recommend using two separate sessions to avoid any confusion.

## Provide feedback

Your feedback on Microsoft Security Copilot generally, and the Defender EASM plugin specifically, is vital to guide current and planned development of the product. The optimal way to provide this feedback is directly in the product, using the feedback buttons at the bottom of each completed prompt. Select **Looks right**, **Needs improvement**, or **Inappropriate**. We recommend that you choose **Looks right** when the result matches expectations, **Needs improvement** when it doesn't, and **Inappropriate** when the result is harmful in some way.  

Whenever possible, and especially when the result you select is **Needs improvement**, please write a few words to explain what we can do to improve the outcome. This request also applies when you expect Microsoft Security Copilot to invoke the Defender EASM plugin, but a different plugin is engaged instead.

## Privacy and data security in Microsoft Security Copilot

When you interact with Microsoft Security Copilot to get Defender EASM data, Copilot pulls that data from Defender EASM. The prompts, the data that's retrieved, and the output that's shown in the prompt results are processed and stored in the Microsoft Security Copilot service.
