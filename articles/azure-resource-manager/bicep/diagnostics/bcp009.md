# Bicep error code - BCP007

This error occurs when the declaration misses a literal value, an array, an object, a parenthesized expression, or a function call at the location.

## Error description

`Expected a literal value, an array, an object, a parenthesized expression, or a function call at this location.`

## Examples

The following example raises the error because the `metadata` declaration is not completed:

You can fix the error by using completing the declaration.

```bicep
metadata description = 'Creates a storage account and a web app'
```
