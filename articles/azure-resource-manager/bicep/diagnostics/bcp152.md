# Bicep error code - BCP152

This error occurs when you try to use a Bicep function as a decorator, but the function isn't suitable for that purpose.

## Error description

`Function <function-name> can't be used as a decorator.`

## Examples

The following example raises the error because `uniqueString()` can't be used as a parameter decorator.

```bicep
@uniqueString()
param name string 
```

You can fix the error by using the proper decorators.  For a list of parameter decorators, see [Decorators](../parameters.md#use-decorators).
