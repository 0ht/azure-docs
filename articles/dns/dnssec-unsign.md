# How to unsign your Azure Public DNS zone (Preview)

This article shows you how to remove Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) from your Azure Public DNS zone.

## Prerequisites

* The DNS zone must be hosted by Azure Public DNS. For more information, see [Manage DNS zones](/azure/dns/dns-operations-dnszones-portal).
* You must have permission to delete a DS record from the parent DNS zone. Most top level domains (.com, .net, .org) allow you to do this using your registrar.

## Unsign a zone

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing DNSSEC from your DNS zone requires that you first remove the delegation signer (DS) record from the parent zone, and wait for the time-to-live (TTL) of the DS record to expire. After the DS record TTL has expired, you can safely unsign the zone.

# [Azure portal](#tab/sign-portal)

To unsign your zone using the Azure portal:

1. 

# [Azure CLI](#tab/sign-cli)

Sign a zone using the Azure CLI:

```azurepowershell-interactive
commands here
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/sign-powershell)

Sign a zone using PowerShell:

```PowerShell
commands here
```
