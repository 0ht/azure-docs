## Get Copilot assistance

Get AI assistance from Copilot to create and edit your API Management policy definitions. Copilot helps you create policies that match your specific requirements without needing to know the XML syntax, and helps you understand and update existing policies.

* [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/author-api-management-policies?toc=%2Fazure%2Fapi-management%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fapi-management%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json) (preview) - Offers policy authoring assistance with natural language prompts in the Azure portal. Use Copilot in Azure alongside API Management's policy editor to create and understand policies.
* [GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) - Provides policy authoring assistance in Visual Studio Code, accelerating policy configuration when using the [Azure API Management Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-apimanagement&ssr=false#overview). Prompt Copilot Chat or Copilot Edits (preview) with natural language to create and refine policy definitions in place.

Example prompt:

```copilot-prompt
Generate a policy that adds an Authorization header to the request with a Bearer token.
```
 
Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. For more information, see [Copilot general use FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).
