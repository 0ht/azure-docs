## Overview

This article describes how to use the [Azure IoT SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node) to create device and backend service application code for device direct methods.

## Create a device application

This section describes how to use device application code to:

* Respond to a direct method called by the cloud
* Trigger a simulated device reboot
* Use the reported properties to enable device twin queries to identify devices and when they were last rebooted

### Connect to a device

### Create a direct method callback

### SDK device samples

## Create a backend application

### Connect to IoT hub

### Invoke a method on a device

### SDK service samples
